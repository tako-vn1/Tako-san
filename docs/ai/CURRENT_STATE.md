# Frigo / Takosan current authority — 2026-09-22

## T18E — `T18E_OTP_RESEND_SECRET_REQUIRED`

Repository ID `1368281478` resolves to `vn-tako1/Frigo-dev`; exact starting
main and production are `66627ffea890dad1cec4e31674449775a940c660`.
Branch `feat/t18e-otp-email-delivery-recovery` contains the provider router,
fail-closed auth, readiness semantics, and regression coverage. Production is
unchanged.

The production `SEND_EMAIL` binding is present, but current sender authority
and the exact failure category could not be read with the available Cloudflare
OAuth scopes. `RESEND_API_KEY` is definitively absent, so production has no
fallback. T18E does not fabricate a primary root cause: current Workers Email
sender authorization remains UNKNOWN until an operator verifies the account or
a sanitized production event is captured.

Code now classifies and logs provider failures without recipient/OTP/body data,
falls through from Workers Email to Resend, distinguishes Resend quota/rate/
sender/recipient failures, invalidates production OTPs even after an unexpected
router exception, and reports readiness as `providerConfigured` separately from
`deliveryVerified=false`. Registration, resend recovery, reset
anti-enumeration, single use, expiry, cooldown, Turnstile, digest-only storage,
and production `devOtp` suppression remain intact. No Google file changed.

Focused auth/email coverage is **6 files / 165 tests PASS**; full Vitest is
**185 files / 4238 tests PASS**. Lint, typecheck, migration smoke and build pass.
The unchanged dependency audit baseline still reports 21 advisories / 6 high.
No migration, workflow, merge, staging, production deploy, secret mutation, or
real email was performed. Next: provision `RESEND_API_KEY`, confirm sender
authorization in both providers, supply an authorized test inbox, and complete
staging then separately authorized production delivery verification. Full
evidence: [T18E_OTP_DELIVERY_RECOVERY.md](T18E_OTP_DELIVERY_RECOVERY.md).

## T18D — `T18D_READY_FOR_REVIEW`

Stable repository ID `1368281478` verified as `vn-tako1/Frigo-dev`;
main/base `07ace57241f8270b2458610979c709bb69b9a65a`, CI #151 (`35584884792`) success,
Deploy #53 (`35585265322`) staging success / production skipped. Branch
`feat/t18d-a11y-human-style-hardening` was created from that exact base and
pushed; implementation freeze is `d3ef61c`. No business/server changes.

The four original human-style findings are fixed. Seven additional scoped P2
findings are also fixed; independent review open P0/P1/P2 = **0/0/0**. The
27-screen review is **14 PASS / 13 PASS_WITH_NOTE / 0 FAIL**. Two P3
observations remain deliberately deferred. Human-style semantic review,
keyboard interaction review, and accessibility-tree/ARIA review were performed;
VoiceOver and NVDA were not performed.

Final focused evidence is **14/14 PASS** in **42.8s**, with strict axe
violations **0**;
log: `.hoplite/artifacts/t18d/final/focused.log`. Final
`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm check:migrations`, and
`pnpm build` logs all pass; Vitest is **185 files / 4226 tests** in **333.25s**:
`.hoplite/artifacts/t18d/final/{lint,typecheck,test,check-migrations,build}.log`.
Fresh style/contrast reruns pass: **39 allowlisted / 0 unjustified** and
**33/33**. Lint/typecheck also pass after the test-only settling correction.

The second full matrix was stopped at approximately case 158 after
`t17-a11y.e2e.ts` sampled scan-review entrance opacity and receipt enable-state
before settle; the error context is retained. The parent patched the test to
wait 350ms **after** async CTAs become enabled, matching the T18C settled-state
convention; no axe rule or design token changed. The settled matrix passed
**349 cases / 5 intentional skips / 0 failures** (354 total, 23.3m) with log
`.hoplite/artifacts/t18d/final/matrix-settled.log` and artifacts under
`.hoplite/artifacts/t18d/final/matrix-settled/`.

All **84 T18D cases PASS**; 162 canonical axe checks have **0 violations**.
The five skips are duplicate project instances of the breakpoint sweep,
which passes once in mobile-390. Axe contrast incomplete records are retained,
not silently treated as passes. Full breakdown/commands are in the T18D report.
[PR #49](https://github.com/vn-tako1/Frigo-dev/pull/49) is OPEN, review-only,
from this branch to unchanged `main`; publication checkpoint `fe1b5d4` matched
remote (6 ahead / 0 behind main, 0/0 vs upstream). Hosted `validate` initially
IN_PROGRESS in run `35677663372` at 01:57 UTC; no review threads then.
CI/review auto-fix enabled; auto-merge disabled. This receipt is doc-only.
Next: inspect settled CI/review feedback. Do not merge or deploy. Existing
`.hoplite/settings.json` modification remains preserved and excluded; T18D
changes are committed, but the overall worktree is therefore not clean.

## Previous T18C receipt (historical; PR #48 is now merged)

**Current: T18C_READY_FOR_REVIEW.** Local certification is complete on
application freeze `6f8f6f40bb2c47dacd33670ac7397b0528b469a8`. Repository ID
`1368281478` resolves to `vn-tako/Frigo-dev`; existing branch
`feat/t18c-final-redesign-certification` retains the correct upstream and
unchanged base `b8447e85f099b800a9a8ebc6c4c137adc9e45a32`.

- Approved ZIP checksum verified; **27/27 direct board/contract comparisons**,
  fresh at 360/390/430/768/1024/1440. Final dispositions: **2 PASS / 25
  PASS_WITH_DOCUMENTED_DIFFERENCE**; no blocked/failed screen or unresolved
  P0/P1/P2. Baseline and pre-fix evidence remain separate and unchanged.
- Browser manifest: **379 PASS / 11 intentional skips / 390 unique cases**,
  162 canonical + 449 regression screenshot files, zero strict axe violations
  and zero horizontal overflow. Three outer-command timeouts required five
  recovery passes; this was not one uninterrupted green runner exit.
- Serial final gates: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (**184 files /
  4222 PASS**, 554.62s), `pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build`,
  `node scripts/t17/style-residuals.mjs` (39/0),
  `node scripts/t17/contrast-audit.mjs` (33/33), `git diff --check`, and
  `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` PASS. Completed 08:23:33 UTC.
- Failure history retained: genuine Home 200%-text P2 fixed at the freeze,
  12/12 focused rerun, interrupted resource-contended CLI-timeout attempt,
  and exact five-case outer-timeout recovery. No coverage or timeout weakened.
- Protected auth/payment/domain/backend/schema/workflow/production boundaries
  remain intact. VoiceOver and NVDA **NOT PERFORMED**; axe incomplete records
  remain visible. No live-provider transaction or remote migration.
- Evidence/report: `T18C_VISUAL_CERTIFICATION.md` and
  `.hoplite/artifacts/t18c/EVIDENCE.md`; published checkpoint `321824d`.
  [PR #48](https://github.com/vn-tako/Frigo-dev/pull/48) is OPEN against `main`,
  auto-merge disabled, CI/review auto-fix enabled. Hosted `validate` **SUCCESS**
  on `289d80a`, run `35578662531`, completed 2026-09-21 08:40:02 UTC.
  Final readiness audit: no unresolved review threads, `MERGEABLE` / `CLEAN`,
  no introduced migration/configuration follow-up. Style (39/0), contrast
  (33/33), worktree/base diff checks and unchanged-source boundary checks PASS.
  This receipt changes documentation only. Next: owner merge permission after
  the latest-head CI remains green; do not merge automatically.
  No merge, deploy or T18D. Preserve uncommitted
  `.hoplite/settings.json` and extracted reference files as workspace state.

## Historical continuation checkpoints (superseded by the result above)

### Text-zoom follow-up — final browser gate found one P2

The complete 390-case run ended **378 passed / 11 intentional skips / 1
failed**: Home overflowed 46px at 1024px with 200% text zoom. The fixed
breakpoint grid kept two narrow columns after rem-scaled sidebar/text growth.
Home now uses wrapping, rem-based flex regions, preserving the wider primary
region at normal sizes. The original zoom gate and an added explicit Home
stacking assertion pass at all six widths: **12/12**. No gate was weakened.
The previous final artifacts will remain separate as `pre-zoom/`; regenerate
all six projects against isolated per-run in-memory Preview servers and rerun
all repository gates before final certification/PR.

### Final repository gates — PASS (application freeze `b024b0d`)

Fresh unfiltered `pnpm test`: **184 files / 4222 tests PASS** (818.46s).
`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build` and
`git diff --check` PASS. Style audit: **39 allowlisted / 0 unjustified**;
contrast: **33/33 PASS**, one informational border pair. The only post-freeze
maintenance is license trailing-whitespace normalization and its regeneration
script; all five font checksums remain unchanged. The final browser run and
fresh visual review remain in progress; no PR/merge/deploy yet.

### Keyboard closure / final-gate checkpoint

Strict T17 target-size follow-up: added existing `tap-target` bounds to new
native brand/title controls; no target assertion was relaxed. Focused
mobile-360 accessibility + gap + flag-off Week run: **14 passed / 1 intentional
boundary-project skip**. The failed full attempt is retained separately;
final clean gate/matrix regeneration restarts after this bounded correction.

Review follow-up: non-recipe legacy Week cards have no detail destination;
their new title buttons were removed rather than advertising a no-op. Existing
choose/change controls remain. Regression **2 red → 5/5 green**; flag-off
routed browser setup **1/1 PASS**. Independent re-review: no remaining P0/P1/P2.
The 384-case attempt and concurrent unit gate were intentionally interrupted
for this correction; a fresh **390-case** run (adds flag-off coverage) follows.

Inventory detail and recipe recommendations now expose native controls;
shopping exposes item-specific checkbox state; shell brand links are native.
Legacy Week card/setup controls retain their existing handlers and draft
contract with native, state-labelled buttons. Two focused pre-fix browser
failures became **12/12 PASS** across six widths. An added sibling-action test
initially failed because an API refetch reordered rows; fixing its locator to
the stable item ID passed (1/1). Router fixtures now mount real Links via
MemoryRouter instead of omitting the newly used export: **37/37 focused unit
tests PASS**, typecheck/targeted ESLint/diff-check PASS. No assertion was removed.
Final complete gates and the unfiltered **384-case** browser run are underway;
interrupted earlier runs are retained as non-final evidence.

### Source-led fix checkpoint

Direct comparison now covers all 27 identities using the approved boards and
their higher-priority written contracts. Localized fixes cover native recipe
links, discovery grid, 640px shell/fixed-action alignment, Landing/Home wide
composition, radio/group naming, Home empty-state heading, privacy sentence
layout, and payment status announcements without countdown chatter. No domain
authority changed. Targeted browser reruns: **43 passed / 5 intentional
project skips**, then **18 passed** (strict dialog axe, discovery/privacy),
then **1 passed** (639/640/767/1024 boundary). `pnpm typecheck` passed.
Exact logs are preserved in `.hoplite/artifacts/t18c/fix-verification.zip`.
Final all-suite certification and screenshot matrix remain pending.

## T18C — final redesign certification — SAFE PAUSE (2026-09-21)

- Exact start gate passed at `b8447e85f099b800a9a8ebc6c4c137adc9e45a32`,
  repository `1368281478` / `omin-jp/Frigo-dev`; clean tree, CI #145 green,
  Deploy #52 staging green and production skipped. No overlapping redesign PR.
- New branch: `feat/t18c-final-redesign-certification`. No merge/deployment.
- Approved Takosan OS boards/ZIP are unavailable: **DIRECT_BOARD_COMPARISON_PENDING**.
  Reconstructed requirements and older Frigo boards are not direct authority.
- Checkpoint A `ac4d90e` pushed with the 162-screenshot baseline archive.
  Baseline: route/overflow/nav 162/162; 15 moderate axe instances/viewport on
  11 identities. Evidence-led presentation fixes applied (landmarks, heading
  order, camera reduced-motion, VietQR dialog focus trap/return) with
  red/green targeted regressions; payment/OTP authority untouched.
- Style audit 39 allowlisted / 0 unjustified; contrast 33/33. Full Vitest
  183 files / 4217 PASS applies only to the `ac4d90e`-era tree, not the pause
  edits; final matrix/gate rerun is the next action.
- Next: rerun matrix + gates on the fixed tree, finalize
  [T18C certification](T18C_VISUAL_CERTIFICATION.md) and the resume plan in
  [T18C WIP handoff](T18C_WIP_HANDOFF.md). Historical results below remain
  unchanged and are not current T18C evidence.

## T18B — payment authority unification — `T18B_READY_FOR_REVIEW` (2026-09-21)

- Final review P1 fix starts at verified local/remote `0926222` on the same
  branch/PR. Issued monthly 49000/annual 499000 offers survive later catalog
  changes; current-price callbacks for those old orders are rejected. Structural
  validation, expiry/terminal-state rejection and replay/grant fences remain.
  Focused **151/151** (65 server payment), with explicit catalog-change and
  corrupted-row coverage; full `pnpm test` **183 files / 4217 PASS** and browser
  **48/48** across six widths. Lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build/diff checks
  PASS. Final commands, fixture/HMR recovery and publication boundary are in
  the report; earlier checkpoint counts below are historical.
- Repository `1368281478` / `omin-jp/Frigo-dev`; exact starting and currently
  verified main `13ff3f22082fc0601a81b90c96edded4741194ac`. Branch
  `feat/t18b-payment-authority`, review-only [PR #47](https://github.com/omin-jp/Frigo-dev/pull/47)
  OPEN, auto-fix CI/review subscription enabled, auto-merge disabled.
- One Worker price table retains **49000 monthly / 499000 annual / VND**.
  It supplies metadata and new offers only. After issuance the persisted intent
  is the immutable amount/plan/currency/order/expiry authority; signed PayOS
  instructions, callbacks and displayed QR must match that offer, not today's
  catalog. Only a valid persisted paid intent grants entitlement. No commercial
  price/discount decision was made.
- Signed callbacks bind order/amount/currency/plan/reference; transactional
  pending-only grants are idempotent and insert missing subscriptions. Provider
  errors fail closed. Legacy shared-secret grants are retired (410 for
  `grantCode`), normal old activation calls remain non-granting compatibility.
- Client checkout/status and fresh `/me` entitlement are identity/generation
  fenced; billing's expected-owner-header exemption is removed. Local cache,
  redirects and modal closure cannot establish Plus. All T18A code preceding
  the legacy Plus endpoint is byte-identical to base.
- Checkpoints A `2aba91a`, B `c00ea9f`, C `1cef30b`, semantic-error fix
  `1aabd32562edc2c5c37b3db9d7d19e1938896084` pushed. Focused 121/121;
  browser six-width 48/48 plus error-state rerun 4/4; implementation full Vitest **183 files /
  4185 tests PASS**; lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build PASS. First full run's
  single style-token failure was corrected in source, with brand/checkout 38/38
  and the complete rerun green. Security review: remaining P0/P1/P2/P3 = 0.
- Merge-readiness follow-up: exact-head CI `35554499704` passed at `2d6ff5a`,
  no review threads. Fixed deployed CSP blocking VietQR (exact image origin in
  both policies), retired the obsolete grant-secret warning, and removed one
  trailing blank line. New regression failed before the CSP fix, then passed:
  104 focused tests and 48/48 browser tests under the real image policy.
  Lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build/full-diff whitespace and built-header
  parity PASS; exact commands/failures are in the report. New-head CI is checked
  separately on the PR before readiness, not inferred from the prior run.
- No migration (38 existing), Inventory Truth, OCR/AI, recipe/planner/Week,
  Wrangler binding, infrastructure or workflow changes. Application-config
  adjustments are only the QR CSP and retired payment warning. No real payment, merge, remote D1 or
  deployment. Baseline main CI #140 and staging Deploy #51 passed; production
  job skipped. T18B is not deployed.
- Managed isolated Preview is ready after removing a hard-coded run-script port
  override; actual metadata and missing-provider checkout were exercised. UI
  provider evidence is synthetic, not live payment certification.
- Next: owner review/merge permission once final-head CI is green; no local blocker.
  Provider channel/secrets and live callback delivery need separately authorized
  operator verification before any release. Exact audit, contract, failures,
  evidence and boundaries: [T18B report](T18B_PAYMENT_AUTHORITY_REPORT.md).
  T17/T18A sections below are historical and unchanged.

## T18A — auth resend expiry contract — `T18A_READY_FOR_REVIEW` (2026-09-21)

- Repository ID `1368281478` currently resolves to `omin-jp/Frigo-dev` (supplied
  `omin-vn` path redirects). Exact main/base remains
  `51d0d3755d83b64185066228d98f44ab7bad5e3c`.
- Branch `feat/t18a-auth-resend-expiry-contract`; review-only PR
  [#46](https://github.com/omin-jp/Frigo-dev/pull/46), OPEN, auto-fix CI/review
  subscription enabled. No merge or deployment performed.
- Pushed checkpoints: server `88096cb7fbea8e3b95f5627ff5a46e8c3d34b462`, client
  `47c3a3391e086caf2760b61ee4e2bfacd331cacf`, security fixtures
  `53f9fefdc9d935bb736a37cdcd9f5b0d0479685e`.
- One unchanged ten-minute server TTL now controls stored OTP expiry and
  registration/resend response metadata. Client uses only returned metadata,
  clears old expiry on malformed/failure/offline outcomes, and preserves T17B
  route lifecycle, credential-free context and nullable delivery truth.
- Forgot-password request/resend returns identical generic lifetime policy
  for known/unknown accounts, never proof of issuance or delivery. Its distinct
  UI/reset semantics are unchanged. Security review found no actionable issue.
- Final local evidence: auth/security 300/300 (server 86/86, client 83/83 in
  focused subsets), full Vitest 180 files/4117 tests, T17/T18A browser matrix
  42/42; lint, typecheck, migration smoke and build PASS. Exact commands and
  hosted CI publication receipt are in the report. Initial browser launch lacked its
  locked Chromium; repaired and rerun green. Initial full run hit the 600s
  shell budget; final full run passed with two workers and no test exclusions.
- Billing/payment UI/behavior, migrations, other Worker files, Inventory Truth,
  OCR/AI, planner and production config have zero diff. T18B remains separate.
- Next: final-head hosted CI and human review only. No local blockers. Exact commands,
  failures, Worker line-by-line explanation and evidence are in
  [T18A_AUTH_RESEND_EXPIRY_REPORT.md](T18A_AUTH_RESEND_EXPIRY_REPORT.md).
  T17B records below remain historical and unmodified.

## Current T17B — contract reconciliation `T17B_COMPLETE`; release pending (2026-09-20)

Branch `feat/t17b-contract-reconciliation` was created from exact `main`
`858759f771baccb85f5ed6fd8e06df2fc0bbb112` in repository id `1368281478`,
`omin-vn/Frigo-dev`. Application HEAD is
`0f358f2f8c9da35c2167489ad6fd63eae8ea8c47`; certification checkpoint is
`00594eba755c6895f9edb9d3076282cf42919c44`. Documentation follows.

- Screens 04–06 are route-driven and history/refresh safe. Screen 06 is the
  planning-goal screen: a native `primary-goal` radio group with the existing
  client values `today`/`week`/`both` plus a review of the server-stored
  fields. `primaryGoal` is client-only (draft + auth state, never sent to
  `/preferences`); after confirmed completion `week` routes to `/week/setup`,
  otherwise `/`. Household size is not clamped: stored `6..20` shows as "5+"
  and round-trips unchanged unless the user explicitly picks a size (explicit
  "5+" writes canonical `5`).
  Screen 05 has exactly seven visible cuisine choices and nine visible
  restriction choices, both including canonical `other`. Stored values outside
  those visible chips, including `italian` and `vegetarian`, survive review and
  completion; spicy level remains independent. Authenticated onboarding updates
  local auth state only after server confirmation. The preserved offline-guest
  session path intentionally skips the server write and completes locally.
- `/auth/verify` context is credential-free, tab-scoped, identity-bound,
  strict-shape/expiry validated, and cleared on route, identity, cancel, and
  success transitions. Delivery is nullable, resend expiry is unknown when the
  API supplies none, failed replacement delivery clears stale claims, leaving
  the route resets loading, and only the server validates OTPs or creates
  sessions.
- The 27-screen registry now requires every declared content marker. Its clean
  reviewer-verified contracts passed 18/18 across six viewports, including
  onboarding direct URLs, refresh, history, native selection state, and no
  `primary-goal`. Older reconstructed-kit language is historical only.
- Post-review fix `56fc01b` reran: focused onboarding/auth 87/87, full Vitest
  180 files/4094, registry 18/18, full T17 216 pass/6 skips/0 failed, lint,
  typecheck, migration smoke, build, and `git diff --check` PASS.
- Certification-checkpoint validation: focused auth 102/102, final verify/onboarding 39/39, full
  Vitest 180 files/4087 tests, T13 60/60, clean six-width T17 216 pass/6
  intentional skips, automated accessibility 12/12 across six viewports, style
  residual 43/43 allowlisted/0 unjustified, and contrast 33/33. Lint,
  typecheck, migration smoke, and build passed.
- Clean evidence is under
  `.hoplite/artifacts/t17-playwright/final-00594eb-clean/`; validation is under
  `.hoplite/artifacts/t17b-validation-00594eb/`. The tested package
  `.hoplite/artifacts/t17b-final-visuals-00594eb.zip` contains 232 entries and
  180 PNGs, with a complete per-screenshot manifest; SHA-256 is
  `d6f6d4f032c0ac637ce5d1523ecc95b1411bc567538bca8d235a7131e6ad9d70`.
  The 390px OTP and all onboarding captures were visually inspected.
- Corrective documentation checks passed for whitespace, required markers,
  protected zero-diff boundaries, ZIP integrity, and all 180 JSON/TSV manifest
  records and hashes. An initial ad hoc validator used the wrong command-field
  name; the corrected `generatingCommand` check found no artifact defect.
- Managed Preview initially inherited an inferred `pnpm dev` run path and could
  not provide the isolated API; guest creation returned 500. The effective run
  path was restored to `node scripts/security-preview.mjs`, the tracked Preview
  settings were restored unchanged, and the final exact-head Preview was ready.
  Supported synthetic reset/login then verified screens 04–06 at 390x844: five
  household radios, 7 cuisine and 9 restriction checkboxes, independent review
  values, and Back/Forward preservation, with no page errors.
- Worker, protected payment, migration, production-infrastructure, and deployed
  production state are unchanged; T17B intentionally changes the documented
  frontend auth/onboarding behavior.
  `PRE-EXISTING PROTECTED AUTH-CONTRACT BLOCKER`: registration reports a
  10-minute OTP lifetime while resend supplies no fresh expiry.
  `PRE-EXISTING PROTECTED PAYMENT-AUTHORITY BLOCKER`: frontend/VietQR prices
  `599000`/`79000` differ from server payment-intent authority
  `499000`/`49000`. Their server/API and payment owners must resolve them in
  separately authorized work. No deployment occurred. Full evidence:
  `docs/ai/T17_UI_V2_REPORT.md`.
- Status is `T17B_COMPLETE`; T17 remains `T17_PARTIAL` only
  because direct board comparison and a human screen-reader walkthrough are
  external and unexecuted.

**Publication/readiness:** replacement PR #45 was opened against exact base
`858759f771baccb85f5ed6fd8e06df2fc0bbb112` from corrective documentation
checkpoint `f901b028af655b419cd96c3a8e29c358de34e636`. At publication head
`1cacd0b08ab788d355cef5ab09d950df038938f8`, hosted validate run `35532565549`
passed and GitHub reported `MERGEABLE / CLEAN`; reviews, review comments,
conversation comments, and unresolved human feedback were empty. The final
local pass reran focused auth/onboarding/session tests 74/74, changed-file
ESLint, typecheck, ZIP integrity/hash, protected-boundary checks, and
`git diff --check` successfully. PR #45 is ready for the authorized user's merge
decision when the documentation-only readiness checkpoint retains green/CLEAN
exact-head provider status. Direct board comparison and NVDA/VoiceOver remain
pending; neither has a named assignee or tracking issue in this repository.
Deploy only through the authorized operator path; production remains untouched.

## Previous T17 — continuation 6: contract gaps closed and certified, status `T17_PARTIAL` (2026-09-19)

Branch `feat/t17-takosan-ui-v2`, PR #44 (repository id `1368281478`, now
`tako-san1/Frigo-dev`). Final-HEAD evidence lives in
`docs/ai/T17_UI_V2_REPORT.md`; this section is the summary.

- **Screen 03 is a real route.** `/auth/verify` is registered with the same
  session guard as `/auth`; the OTP state is derived from the route over the
  unchanged auth state machine (Turnstile, verify/resend bodies, DEC-012,
  private-session capture untouched). A tab-scoped, code-free verification
  context (`features/auth/verify-context.ts`) makes refresh/back safe; a direct
  load with no context renders an honest "no verification pending" state with
  real exits. 14 regression tests (`auth-verify-route.test.tsx`).
- **27 registered screens certified mechanically** per width
  (`tests/e2e/t17-ui/t17-registry.e2e.ts` + `screen-registry.ts`): route
  resolves, visible proof, nav rule, no overflow — on real seeded truth
  (onboarding via UI, planner plan generated, T13 scan evidence).
- **Semantic-token migration finished.** 991 codemod replacements + manual
  dark-context sites; zero raw palette classes outside the protected payment
  UI (43 sites, explicitly allowlisted with reason);
  `scripts/t17/style-residuals.mjs` is enforced by `takosan-brand.test.tsx`.
  Two arbitrary hex values removed. Zero emerald / transition-all / animate-in.
- **WCAG-AA measured**: `scripts/t17/contrast-audit.mjs` 33/33 semantic pairs
  pass (kit `text-muted` darkened to `#6F6B64`; `warning-strong`/`danger-strong`
  added). axe-core over 25 surfaces + OTP flow: 0 serious/critical. Viewport
  zoom re-enabled (was `user-scalable=no`). One h1 per surface, 0 images
  without alt, all targets ≥ 44 px (measured). Shared `useModalFocus` +
  `BottomSheet` primitive give every sheet/dialog trap/Escape/focus-return.
- **Reduced motion certified** on auth, onboarding, sheet/dialog, cooking,
  planner and scan review (no running keyframes, no spatial transitions
  > 200 ms; decorative pulse/ping/bounce and `transition-tap` collapse under
  the media query).
- **Visual contract**: canonical loop now 25 surfaces incl. `scan-review`,
  `receipt-review`, `scan`, `notifications`, `household`, `otp-empty`; state
  matrix (loading/error/empty/offline/sheet/dialog/long Vietnamese/keyboard
  focus/mobile fixed action + keyboard viewport). Human review of the 1440/390
  captures fixed: canvas width cap, aligned fixed bars, Plus/cooking phone
  wrappers, cooking title truncation, UNKNOWN-expiry tone on Home, 44 px brand
  links, honest OTP subtitle.
- **Gates at final HEAD**: see the report's Verification table (lint, typecheck,
  vitest, migration smoke, build, T13 suite, six-width T17 matrix, residual
  greps, worker diff 0, payment boundary 0 lines from this continuation).
- **Remaining blockers for `T17_COMPLETE`**: (1) board comparison — the kit
  ZIP (boards + `screens/*.md` + `SCREEN_REGISTRY`) was not available in the
  sandbox, so captures were reviewed against in-repo contracts only; a holder
  of the ZIP must compare the preserved captures and diff
  `screen-registry.ts`; (2) an assistive-technology (screen reader)
  walkthrough — automated semantics are clean but the human pass is unexecuted.

## Previous T17 — continuation 4: full-diff review with 10 latent defects fixed (2026-09-19)

**Continuation 5 — release prep (same day).** Inspecting fresh screenshots
for the PR exposed a **P1**: Tailwind `semantic` colour keys were camelCase so
25 of 28 kebab-case `semantic-*` utilities used across the new UI compiled to
no CSS (empty sidebar CTA, missing text/action colours). Fixed in
`tailwind.config.js`; new unit guard fails on the old config. Gates after fix:
lint PASS, typecheck PASS, vitest **178/4047**, build PASS, T17 Playwright
390/768/1440 **51/51**. PR opened into `main` (see HANDOFF for number/CI).
Deployment remains operator-driven per `DEPLOYMENT.md`; no new migrations.

**Continuation 4b (same day) — second pass + first local T13 run.** Three more
defects fixed: `FoodPreferencesPage` no longer flips onboarding completion
client-side (uses `setOnboardingFromServer(auth.isOnboarded, draft)`); nav
indicator `layoutId` is per-nav so the hidden bottom bar/rail cannot hijack
the shared-layout animation; dev-OTP autofill is a real `<button>`. **T13
Playwright ran locally for the first time: 54/60 → 60/60** after (a) updating
the logout test's target from `/profile` to `/me` (T17 redirect) and (b)
fixing a *pre-existing* failure (confirmed on base `769d085`) where the
presentation test faked onboarding via `localStorage`, which migration 0038's
server-authoritative hydrate overwrites — the test now completes the real
onboarding flow. Full T17 matrix: 360 **16/16**; other five widths **82 pass /
2 by-design skips / 1 test-only `networkidle` stall**, fixed and re-verified
**12/12** at all six widths. Lint/typecheck PASS; harness consumers 27/27.
Worker/PayOS diff still zero. Status remains `T17_PARTIAL`.

A file-by-file review of the entire redesign diff (`769d085..HEAD`, 76 files)
found and fixed: two **tenancy** violations (new settings pages used unscoped
query keys; now `queryKeys.foodPreferences()`/`planningPreferences()` with
invalidate-after-write), two **honesty** gaps (offline planning save showed
success although the write was only queued — now an explicit pending-sync
state; offline planning read hung forever — now an honest unavailable state;
household badge claimed a server status — now session fact only), two
**IA/layout** regressions (TopBar never showed the settings gear on `/me` and
still navigated to legacy paths; `/scan/*` review workspaces were wrongly
immersive and ReceiptReview's CTA would collide with the restored nav), three
**accessibility** gaps in the new auth components and Switch primitive (label
association, OTP group/digit names, reveal-button name/state, autocomplete,
`aria-describedby`), a **motion** defect (Switch thumb `layout` on an absolute
child; now transform-driven and reduced-motion-governed) plus half-implemented
inventory row enter/exit, and the **fixed-action primitives** pinned under the
mobile nav. One test-only fix (screenshot spec `networkidle` stall). Gates
after fixes: lint PASS, typecheck PASS, full vitest **178/4046 PASS**,
migration smoke PASS, build PASS, focused UI/auth **65/65**, T17 Playwright
re-verified for the affected tests. Worker/PayOS diff still zero. Status
remains `T17_PARTIAL` (slate-palette migration, human screenshot review, T13
local run outstanding). Full table: `docs/ai/T17_UI_V2_REPORT.md`.

Third checkpoint on `feat/t17-takosan-ui-v2`: all 86 indiscriminate
`transition-all` utilities were replaced by a scoped `transition-tap` token
(enumerated properties; layout never transitions); the remaining per-screen
motion stories landed (cooking steps transition directionally via Slide,
inventory list animates add/remove keyed by stable server identity with
AnimatePresence/layout, scan crossfade verified reduced-motion-safe); the
state-class matrix gained bottom-sheet, honest offline-banner and 200% text
zoom tests. The zoom gate exposed real defects — rem-sized nav icons forced
flex min-content overflow, the Profile hub card and Home header refused to
truncate, RecipeCard/IngredientRow rows could not wrap, and the inventory
search input lacked `min-w-0` — all fixed and verified clean by probe at 390
and 360 (desktop and mobile emulation) and by the suite at all six widths.
Two test-code defects (case-sensitive offline regex; zoom measured before
layout settle) were fixed test-only and re-verified **12/12** at all widths.
Gates: lint PASS, typecheck PASS, full vitest **178 files / 4046 tests PASS**,
migration smoke PASS, build PASS; the full T17 matrix run passed everything
except those two test defects, which the targeted re-run proves green.
Remaining honest gaps for `T17_COMPLETE`: 856 `slate-*` neutral-palette sites
still on legacy pages (brand `takosan-*` aliases are kit-permitted), human
design review of the canonical screenshots, and a first local run of the T13
Playwright inventory suite. Worker/PayOS diff remains zero; `main` untouched.

## Previous T17 — continuation 3 (2026-09-19)

## Previous T17 — continuation 2 (2026-09-19)

Status `T17_PARTIAL` per the Takosan Redesign OS v2.0.0 kit. Branch
`feat/t17-takosan-ui-v2` from live main `769d08597563f816ef9c1dd9523fdafb687de3e2`
implements: the full semantic token layer (CSS `--semantic-*` + tailwind
`semantic-*`), the kit type/radius/elevation scales, `motion@13.4.0` with a
`MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"` provider and token-driven motion
primitives, a shared primitives module, a responsive AppShell V2 (mobile bottom
nav / tablet rail / desktop sidebar, immersive-only nav hiding, real-link
navigation with `aria-current`), the settings/account IA split with four new
dedicated pages over real server contracts (`/me/preferences`,
`/me/household`, `/settings/planning`, `/settings/notifications`,
`/settings/privacy`, `/settings/app`) plus redirects, planner canonicalization
with param-preserving Week redirects while the feature flag stays the rollout
authority, onboarding step routes, removal of the fabricated household
invite/join/member/QR flows in favor of honest unavailable states, removal of
phone-width emulation across 20+ shell pages, and brand cleanup to zero
user-visible Frigo/emerald presentation. PayOS/payment grants received zero
application change: `git diff 769d085 -- src/worker` is empty and the only
payment-file diff is 12/12 presentation-only lines in VietQRModal.

Verification executed after implementation: `pnpm lint` PASS, `pnpm typecheck`
PASS, `pnpm test` **178 files / 4046 tests PASS** (re-run after the
continuation), `pnpm check:migrations` PASS
(sqlite3 CLI installed into the session environment, as the repo setup script
does), `pnpm build` PASS, and the new isolated T17 Playwright suite
(`playwright.t17.config.ts`, `tests/e2e/t17-ui/`) passing at
mobile-390 / tablet-768 / desktop-1440. Baseline gates on main `769d085` passed
identically before edits. `main` untouched; no merge, deploy, D1, PayOS, or
production mutation. (The gaps listed when this paragraph was first written —
AuthPage decomposition, the 360/430/1024 matrix and canonical screenshots —
were closed by continuation 2 below; the current honest gap list lives at the
end of this section and in `docs/ai/T17_UI_V2_REPORT.md`.)

Continuation 2 (same day, same branch): the **AuthPage monolith was
decomposed** into `src/web/features/auth/*` (AuthShell/LoginMode/RegisterMode/
OtpMode/ForgotPasswordMode/GoogleAuthSection/AuthField) with the kit's
auth-state transition and byte-compatible security semantics — the four auth
suites pass **11/11**. All **no-op animation utilities** (`animate-in`,
`zoom-in-95`, `slide-in-from-*` — dead classes from an uninstalled plugin)
were retired across 15 files onto reduced-motion-safe utilities. The T17
visual suite now certifies **all six widths** (360/390/430/768/1024/1440) and
captured **17 canonical screenshots per certified width**; the 360 run exposed
and fixed a real `/shopping` horizontal overflow (`min-w-0` on the quick-add
controls). Final gates after continuation: lint PASS, typecheck PASS, full
vitest **178/4046 PASS**, migration smoke PASS, build PASS, T17 Playwright
**42/42 PASS** at certified widths (full matrix green). Remaining honest gaps:
per-screen `transition-all`/motion-primitive migration, semantic-token
migration of legacy-styled pages, partial state-class matrix, and human design
review of the screenshots. Worker/PayOS diff remains zero.

## Current T16 follow-up — PWA cache and Google recovery deployed (2026-09-19)

Production evidence showed `/auth` and `/sw.js` returning `CF-Cache-Status: HIT`,
while the deployed Service Worker still used the fixed `takosan-pwa-v2` cache.
The repository registered `/sw.js`, but `_headers` targeted the unused
`/service-worker.js` path. This allowed old HTML and the old worker to survive
releases and explains why affected devices kept the stale auth bundle. Google
GIS itself loaded and opened the real account popup in a clean Chromium profile;
the affected browser's unavailable state is therefore consistent with that
stale client/content-blocking boundary, not a credential-less fallback.

The deployed release injects the exact release SHA into `sw.js`, registers
the SHA-qualified worker with `updateViaCache: none`, checks for updates on load,
online and foreground, deletes only previous Takosan release caches, and
best-effort navigates already-open same-origin clients once when an older release
cache is replaced. The navigation starts only after cache cleanup and
`clients.claim()` because awaiting it inside activation can deadlock the new
document fetch. Network navigation refreshes the offline shell and cache writes remain
inside the fetch lifetime. `/auth` and `/sw.js` are `no-store`; hashed assets
explicitly remove the inherited header and remain one-year immutable. Google
GIS uses a numeric clamped button width and its retry script has explicit error
and referrer handling.

The protected deploy workflow builds with the immutable release SHA and, after
exact-SHA readiness convergence, verifies live `/auth`, `/sw.js`, a hashed asset,
and the SHA embedded in the worker. Local Wrangler reproduced the effective
headers exactly. A two-release Chromium exercise proved one document request on
clean install and exactly one best-effort document navigation on update, with the
old cache removed and the new controller/cache bound to the new SHA. Focused
tests passed **116/116**; full `pnpm test` passed **178 files / 4046 tests**;
lint, typecheck, migration smoke, production build, shell syntax and diff check
passed. The additional non-gate `pnpm audit --audit-level high` reported the
existing lockfile's 21 advisories (6 high) in development/deployment tooling
paths (`wrangler`/`miniflare` `undici`, `jsdom` `ws`, and direct build-time
`sharp`); this change does not modify dependencies or ship those packages in the
browser bundle, so remediation remains a separate dependency-upgrade task. No
migration, D1 write, PayOS/payment change, recipe-authority change or
production data mutation is included. PR #42 head
`54dd81b3ba260843ed39d625c8e0b7c2f4cef831` passed CI `35415335137` and merged
as main `6a016f185cae9c51ab5a1fc873a8a05a10a57edd`. Exact-main CI `35415536459`
and staging Deploy `35415763483` passed. Protected production Deploy
`35415843682` passed every gate and published Worker version
`2f228dc9-d97b-4eb1-8cff-9a0f2df3b51c`, preserving recipe authority
`shadow/0/false` and D1 ledger 38 / tip `0038_auth_onboarding_completion.sql`.

Independent production checks found readiness on the exact main SHA with
database/queue OK and only the existing `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING`
warning. `/auth` serves the current bundle with `no-store` (Cloudflare Assets
may still label the edge response `HIT`), `/sw.js` is `MISS` plus `no-store`,
the worker embeds the exact main SHA, and hashed assets are one-year immutable.
A clean Chromium profile loaded real GIS, opened the `accounts.google.com`
account chooser, and obtained the exact-SHA Service Worker controller with only
the matching Takosan cache. A deployment cannot force a
closed, suspended, or browser-blocked legacy tab to execute; reload/reopen or
navigation is the guaranteed recovery boundary, while this release adds future
load/online/foreground update checks.

## Current T15C-D — 1% production Canary safe stop (2026-09-19)

Canonical repository ID `1368281478` resolves to `frigo-6/Frigo-dev`; PR #38 and
PR #39 are merged and canonical main is `347b536950cf54d25a2d6a880c3c2cb3d8c8f329`.
Exact-main CI `35409762462` and automatic staging Deploy `35409964105` passed;
staging used `static/0/false` and production was skipped. Fresh local baseline
passed seed/import, typecheck, lint, migration smoke through 0038, build, and
full Vitest **178 files / 4044 tests**. Public production remains Worker
`6c336889-680d-4cc3-b03b-1007849aa738` at `b41aa468...`, `shadow/0/false`,
database/queue/email healthy, and 71 deterministic user-facing recipes; only
the existing `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING` warning remains.

No authorized operator-owned INCLUDE/EXCLUDE household pair was supplied and no
customer account was inspected or enumerated. Local Wrangler is unauthenticated,
so the fresh direct D1 drift/FK/quick-check/tail audit and Worker secret
provisioning were also unavailable. No secret, config, deploy, D1, migration,
R2, media, or authority mutation occurred. Classification:
`T15C_D_BLOCKED_AUTHORIZED_TEST_HOUSEHOLDS_UNAVAILABLE`. Production stays
`shadow / 0 / false`. Receipt:
`recipe-catalog/T15C_D_PRODUCTION_1PCT_CANARY_CERTIFICATION.md`.
Receipt PR #40 passed exact-head CI `35410893001`, merged as `763d7e904798dc513c60d4da5f876598570c12fb`, then passed exact-main CI `35411093064` and automatic staging Deploy `35411300235` on `static/0/false`; production was skipped and remained unchanged.

## Current T15C-C — authorized canary test cohort mechanism READY (dormant; production still shadow) — 2026-09-19

`RECIPE_CATALOG_TEST_COHORT_ENABLED` + `RECIPE_CATALOG_TEST_INCLUDE`/`EXCLUDE` (Worker secrets holding SHA-256 digests of `recipe-catalog-test-cohort:<householdId>`) give operator-owned test households a deterministic server-side include/exclude override for the D1 canary; precedence exclude > include > `isRecipeCanaryTenant`. Parsed and evaluated only when mode=`canary` (plus cutover, switch exactly `true`, authenticated tenant); in static/shadow/d1 the variables are inert, so emergency rollback is the single change canary→shadow/static with no secret cleanup (review P1). An active cohort must name ≥1 include AND ≥1 exclude household (`TEST_COHORT_PAIR_REQUIRED`, review P2). Malformed, duplicate, overlapping, oversized, half-applied, or one-sided canary configuration is fatal in production readiness (`CONFIG_RECIPE_CATALOG_TEST_COHORT`) and serves static loudly at request time. Diagnostics gain only a bounded `assignmentReason`. Normal FNV bucketing is byte-for-byte unchanged. No migration; `deploy.yml`/wrangler/release manifest untouched and guard-tested to stay that way. Classification `T15C_AUTHORIZED_TEST_COHORT_READY`; production remains `shadow / 0 / false`. Receipt: `recipe-catalog/T15C_AUTHORIZED_TEST_COHORT.md`.
## Current T15C — production Canary safe stop; authority still shadow (2026-09-18)

Fresh audit on canonical main `b41aa4682481447795350fc1a9eeb1e80887bd0e` passed every local gate (`pnpm test` 176 files / 4008 tests PASS). Public read-only production checks: readiness commit equals main, database ok, five `/api/v1/recipes` reads at 71 in deterministic order, legacy IDs 200, reviewed D1-only IDs 404; the latest production Deploy receipt (run 35404106102) records `recipeCatalogMode=shadow`, canary 0, cutover false on that exact SHA. No authorized operator-owned inside/outside 1% cohort and no Cloudflare credentials were available, so Canary was not dispatched and nothing in production changed. Classification `T15C_CANARY_BLOCKED_AUTHORIZED_COHORT_UNAVAILABLE`; receipt `recipe-catalog/T15C_PRODUCTION_CANARY_SAFE_STOP.md`.

## Current T16 follow-up — OTP sender fix and guest account gates ready for release (2026-09-19)

A production-bound Email Service diagnostic isolated the OTP failure to the
sender identity: Cloudflare rejected `no-reply@frigo.tungjpstore.net` with
`email sending not authorized for subdomain 'frigo.tungjpstore.net'`. The zone
apex `tungjpstore.net` is the domain currently onboarded for Email Service, and
the same remote binding accepted a harmless diagnostic from
`no-reply@tungjpstore.net` and returned a provider `messageId`. This proves the
request reached the email provider and removes D1, Turnstile and OTP generation
as the root cause for the observed registration failures. Actual inbox receipt
of a real OTP is still pending and must not be claimed yet.

Implementation commit `31006994849ee9f6d78ae6114f82d77d41efc784`
changes the transactional sender to the onboarded apex,
maps the provider's subdomain authorization message to the sanitized
`sender_not_verified` category, keeps resend available when the optional KV
cooldown store is unavailable, clears cooldown best-effort after failed sends,
and returns actionable `503 OTP_RESEND_UNAVAILABLE` for unexpected resend
failures. The OTP screen now waits for a fresh Turnstile token before resend and
recreates the widget after each consumed token.

Guest account boundaries are explicit. A guest may open `/auth`; `/plus`
replaces prices and payment UI with an account-required explanation and a link
to `/auth?mode=login&returnTo=%2Fplus`; the profile upgrade CTA points to the
same login flow. A successfully authenticated, already-onboarded account safely
returns to `/plus`. Authenticated users retain the existing Plus screen and no
PayOS, checkout, billing, webhook or settlement implementation changed.

Local verification is green: focused auth/email/account-gate suites passed **86
tests / 4 files**; full `pnpm test` passed **176 files / 4008 tests**; `pnpm
lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:migrations` (`migration-smoke=ok`), `pnpm
build`, and `git diff --check` passed. Real-browser checks at 390x844 and
1440x1000 confirmed the guest pricing/payment UI is absent, profile and Plus
CTAs route to auth, `returnTo=%2Fplus` is retained, and the auth page remains
available to a guest session.

This candidate is not yet merged or deployed. Production remains on Worker
`e8164168-9566-475b-b0fa-7508368bf3e7` at main
`0cb5d2c08fa24479ecce6b4c4e5f73b31a920ff5`, D1 ledger 38 / tip 0038, and
recipe authority `shadow/0/false`. No migration or production data write is
required. Next action: commit, exact-head CI, normal merge, exact-main CI,
protected production deploy preserving `shadow/0/false`, then verify a real
registration/resend or forgot-password email arrives without exposing its OTP.

## Current T16 — auth funnel and CSP hotfix deployed; OTP receipt pending (2026-09-19)

PR #34 merged the auth-funnel implementation commit
`3633a2fa8a0827a6aa31a3c86da7fb680a6e0f2a` and documentation commit
`66e8073161cf418ffe4df2ed6cece75d56087af1` to canonical main
`d6c981b1a67001b807f03166109f661bc753728c`. Exact-head PR CI run
`35385363064` and exact-main CI run `35385844667` succeeded. T16 now has one
entry funnel: landing offers guest or account, auth sends returning onboarded
accounts to the app and new accounts to three preference-only onboarding steps,
and onboarding contains no duplicate login/Google/Apple chooser.

Production D1 migration run `35386276549` succeeded and applied only
`0038_auth_onboarding_completion.sql`. The ledger is 38 / tip
`0038_auth_onboarding_completion.sql`; FK, quick check, aggregate drift, recipe
media and catalog certification passed. The recoverable Time Travel bookmark is
`000000d3-00000000-000050ea-709daab542439d8e8fab731b65dab714`.

Production Deploy run `35386532369` succeeded after the required Environment
approval. Worker version `c0161a22-1987-42dd-99c4-0a5874d4fadb` serves exact
SHA `d6c981b1a67001b807f03166109f661bc753728c`; previous Worker
`c6fa2ce8-f35b-4485-ad38-09dbc19738d1` remains the rollback reference. Recipe
authority stayed `shadow`, canary stayed `0`, and cutover stayed `false`.
`SEND_EMAIL` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` are present; `/api/v1/config` exposes the
expected client ID. Readiness reports the exact SHA with database, queue and
email configured; the only degradation is the existing
`CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING`. `scripts/post-deploy-smoke.sh` passed.

OTP delivery now uses the structured Cloudflare Email Service binding with
Resend fallback and sanitized provider categories. Production registration and
resend return `OTP_DELIVERY_UNAVAILABLE` when no provider accepts the message,
and the undelivered challenge is invalidated. Google GIS and backend audience
verification now consume the same runtime `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` exposed by
`/config`; signed credentials remain mandatory.

Local release verification passed lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build, full
Vitest **174 files / 4002 tests**, recipe seed/import checks, local D1 schema gate
through 0038, and diff check. Production Playwright at 390x844 and 1440x900
verified no horizontal overflow, Google GIS rendering, and a Google click opening
`accounts.google.com` without an origin error. The live guest path completed
landing -> guest session -> reload-safe three-step onboarding -> preferences ->
app; `PATCH /api/v1/preferences` returned 200 and the
`__Host-frigo_session` cookie remained `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`.

The production console exposed CSP blocks for Google Fonts, Google GSI styles,
and Cloudflare Web Analytics. Hotfix implementation
`79dfca6483d90fcf33380acfe33f880c1e6ff7a5` adds only the required explicit
origins in `src/worker/config/csp.ts` and `public/_headers`, plus unit coverage;
no wildcard or script `unsafe-inline` was added. PR #35 head
`c14a3755d95ddae316d5e6636ef85f9784ac4a54` passed CI `35388666150` and merged
normally as main `0cb5d2c08fa24479ecce6b4c4e5f73b31a920ff5`; exact-main CI
`35388963509` passed.

Production hotfix Deploy `35389274233` passed the Environment gate, full local
gates, exact-head CI recheck, read-only D1 ledger/schema gate, Cloudflare deploy,
post-deploy smoke and exact-SHA convergence in one attempt. Worker version
`e8164168-9566-475b-b0fa-7508368bf3e7` serves exact SHA
`0cb5d2c08fa24479ecce6b4c4e5f73b31a920ff5`; previous Worker
`c0161a22-1987-42dd-99c4-0a5874d4fadb` is the immediate rollback reference.
The immutable manifest and live catalog confirm recipe authority remains
`shadow`, canary `0`, cutover `false`, and 71 user-facing recipes. D1 remains
ledger 38 / tip 0038; no migration was run for the CSP hotfix.

Independent production checks confirmed the exact SHA, expected Google client
ID, configured email service, database/queue OK, and only the pre-existing
`CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING` warning. The live CSP header contains the
explicit Google Fonts/GSI/Cloudflare Insights origins. Playwright at 390x844 and
1440x900 found no horizontal overflow, loaded fonts, rendered one Google iframe,
and captured no CSP console violation. The Insights script was allowed by CSP
but its host returned `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` from the verification network.

Real OTP delivery remains unverified. `tungjpstore@gmail.com` already exists in
`auth_accounts`; both headless and headed automated Chrome displayed the real
Turnstile checkbox but could not produce a token, so no forgot-password request
was sent and no email receipt may be claimed. One legitimate production guest
test record was created and intentionally retained. No PayOS/payment, recipe
authority, Inventory Truth, or Week behavior changed.

`88e8b54de121125866b2ff813e56e33277decf1c`, five catalog responses at 71,
legacy IDs 200, reviewed D1-only IDs 404. Production D1 `frigo-db` remains
ledger 37 / tip `0037_recipe_catalog_scale.sql`, 500 recipes, 500 runtime
fields, and 500 media rows pending / 0 ready. Read-only SELECTs reported
`changes=0`, `rows_written=0`; a fresh aggregate catalog certification passed at
500 recipes / 2 approved batches / release `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`. No migration
or production D1 write occurred.

No authorized operator-owned inside-1% or outside-1% production test cohort was
available in repository/env/operator inputs, and no customer household IDs were
inspected. Production Canary was not dispatched and no Environment approval was
requested. Durable evidence: `recipe-catalog/T15C_B_AUTHORIZED_COHORT_SAFE_STOP.md`.
Classification: `T15C_B_AUTHORIZED_TEST_COHORT_UNAVAILABLE`; next action is to
obtain both authorized cohorts, then resume at exactly 1% through the protected
workflow. Full D1, media/R2, T14G, Inventory Truth/T09/T11, PayOS/auth remain
out of scope.

## Current T15C-A — bounded canary control-plane wiring in review (2026-09-18)

Certified base main is `6f589d0201499a3729d343e42ccb6d19fdff217a`, the normal
merge of PR #31 (`bb14ba3dcf594fdf4a71fa6bbd6e72fefa52e02e`). PR #29 was closed
without merge as superseded. Branch `codex/t15c-canary-control-plane` adds only
Deploy workflow policy, release-manifest validation/tests, and the T15C-A receipt
(`docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T15C_A_CANARY_CONTROL_PLANE.md`).

Canary wiring PR #32 remains open and mergeable; its final docs checkpoint has
passed exact-head CI and is awaiting independent review. It must not be merged
or used to dispatch production canary from this task.

The release matrix is `static/0/false`, `shadow/0/false`, or
`canary/{1,2,5}/true`; `d1`, `full`, `full_d1`, arbitrary percentages, and
100% canary fail closed. Automatic `workflow_run` deploys remain static/0/false.
Mode, percent, and derived cutover are recorded in the immutable release
manifest and passed to both Wrangler jobs from validated release outputs.

Local focused tests pass (121/121), full suite passes (173 files / 3995 tests),
and seed/import/lint/typecheck/migration/build/diff gates pass. No runtime
canary code, migrations, production D1, Worker, media/R2, Inventory Truth,
PayOS/auth, or T14G changed. Production canary remains unauthorized and
unactivated; stop after opening the new PR and exact-head hosted CI review.

## Current T15B-SHADOW — production Shadow certified; safe stop before canary (2026-09-18)

Production Shadow certification is complete on canonical main `88e8b54de121125866b2ff813e56e33277decf1c` in repository `1368281478` (`frigo-6/Frigo-dev`). PR #30 (`ad3e1d1656418aaf495b130443d6514926b8bdca`) merged with a zero-file tree delta; exact-main CI `35336548833` passed, automatic staging Deploy `35336830786` passed with STATIC71, and production Shadow Deploy `35337110268` passed release `105574386006` and production `105574426707` after the required Environment approval. Production now serves Worker `c6fa2ce8-f35b-4485-ad38-09dbc19738d1` at exact SHA `88e8b54de121125866b2ff813e56e33277decf1c`; bounded convergence passed in one attempt / 574 ms.

Independent anonymous production checks prove `configured=shadow`, `selected/actual source=static`, five repeated `/api/v1/recipes` responses at 71, legacy `vn-canh-01` and `gl-12` HTTP 200, and five reviewed D1-only IDs HTTP 404. Cloudflare tail records sanitized Shadow comparisons with D1 500/500 hydrated, release `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`, readiness `ready`, zero drift/order/hydration errors, `shadow_errors=0`, and no authority leak. Existing D1 migration receipt `35329772751` remains the only migration evidence: tip 0037, ledger 37, 500 recipes/runtime fields, 2/2 approved batches, FK `[]`, quick check `ok`; no migration or additional D1 write occurred.

Durable receipt: `recipe-catalog/T15B_SHADOW_CERTIFICATION.md`. Rollback remains available through the approved Deploy workflow with `recipe_catalog_mode=static`; previous Worker `ab8ff038-2aaa-468b-a9de-8c5d94f14052` is retained. PR #29 remains open/conflicting and was not merged. Canary, full D1, cutover, media/R2, T14G, Inventory Truth/T09/T11, PayOS/auth changes remain out of scope. Classification: `T15B_SHADOW_COMPLETE`; stop before canary/full D1.

## Previous T15B-PRE checkpoint — STATIC certified; SHADOW wiring PR ready (superseded 2026-09-18)

Canonical main remained `0fe2cf071693208f6c642d8cbd994f5a79b5a2cf` in repository `1368281478` (`frigo-6/Frigo-dev`); PR #29 stayed open and unmerged. Existing production D1 receipt run `35329772751` is SUCCESS and independently records ledger 37/tip `0037_recipe_catalog_scale.sql`, 500 recipes/runtime fields, approved batches `2/2`, release `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`, FK `[]`, `quick_check=ok`, and 500 pending/0 ready media rows. No migration was dispatched again.

Static production Deploy run `35333517052` passed release `105563003928`, required production Environment approval, production `105563057055`, full gates, read-only schema gate, smoke, and exact-SHA convergence (attempt 1, 587 ms). Worker version changed from `56979cb5-e1a8-4241-8a4c-2432d41cc439` to `ab8ff038-2aaa-468b-a9de-8c5d94f14052`, serving exact SHA `0fe2cf071693208f6c642d8cbd994f5a79b5a2cf`. Five repeated live checks returned healthy database/config, static source, and 71 recipes; legacy IDs remained available and sampled Batch B IDs were absent. Full evidence: `recipe-catalog/T15B_PRE_STATIC_RECEIPT.md`.

Authority audit found no approved existing Shadow switch. PR #30 from `codex/t15b-shadow-wiring` contains only minimal reviewed workflow plumbing and guardrails for a `static|shadow` input; canary/full-D1 are not expressible. Local focused tests are 99/99; full gates are lint, typecheck, 173 files/3976 tests, migration smoke, build, and diff-check PASS. Implementation head `97aff50d…` exact CI run `35335079345` is SUCCESS; the final documentation head must also pass exact-head CI. Classification: `T15B_PRE_SHADOW_WIRING_PR_READY`; stop for independent review. No Shadow activation, canary, full D1, media/R2, T14G, Inventory Truth, PayOS, auth, force-push, or history rewrite.

## Current T15A — pre-production rollout hardening COMPLETE (production untouched)

T14F merged to main `9be395d0…`. T15A schema-gate hardening merged via PR #26 → main `70cf7e0d…` (`scripts/d1-schema-gate.mjs` derives required migrations from `migrations/`; `d1-migration-check.mjs` pinned chain + `catalog` certification). T15A-R / T15A-R2 merged via PR #27 → main `0fe2cf07…` (exact-main CI SUCCESS; automatic staging deploy SUCCESS, exact-SHA convergence via the helper on attempt 1, production SKIPPED): `scripts/wait-for-deployed-release.mjs` (bounded exact-SHA polling; root cause of Deploy 35288137887's false negative); `verifyDeployedRelease` requires `readiness.commit` to be a canonical 40-hex SHA (malformed/missing fail closed; only a healthy, correct-environment body with a *different valid* SHA is `RELEASE_PROPAGATION_PENDING`); workflow wiring — `catalog` step in `production-d1-migrate.yml` (after `verify`, before the remote schema gate), shell-interpolated input removed, staging + production deploy proof via the helper, permissions unchanged — with unconditional guardrail tests. `recipe-catalog/t15a-r/workflows.patch` and `r2-wired-series.mbox` are consumed audit evidence. Production: D1 not migrated (historical last verified tip 0034 — re-query live before Phase B), Worker `4ed98514…`, static 71, no shadow/canary/media/T14G. Receipt + resume requirements: `recipe-catalog/T15A_WIP_HANDOFF.md`.

## Current T14F — T14F_DEVELOPMENT_COMPLETE (T14F-A/B/C certified; 500-recipe catalog dev-certified; production untouched)

T14F-A pilot certified (`b0150d0…`); T14F-B 399 scale recipes certified (`7d667523…`); **T14F-C certified and closed**: 0037 promoted byte-identical to the certified factory artifact (`68e52e6d…`), shipped manifest **500 recipes / 2 batches** (`rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`, `fa47d31f…`), fresh 0001→0037 / 0036→0037 / production-forward 0034→…→0037 replay PASS, D1 readiness READY 500, static/shadow/canary/full-D1 PASS (reader 5 statements, no N+1), user flows incl. Batch B recipes across six cuisines PASS, T09/T11 unchanged. Certificate: `recipe-catalog/T14F_C_500_CATALOG_CERTIFICATION.md`.

Closure (safe stop `44c0ad38…` resolved): `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, full `pnpm test` **171 files / 3913 tests**, typecheck, `check:migrations` through 0037, `recipe:seed:check`, `recipe:import:check` (500/2), `git diff --check` — all PASS. Hosted validate on `44c0ad38…` failed only in the five real-D1 suites: replaying 0001→0037 in one workerd overflows workerd 1.20250718's 1 MiB prepared-statement cache and segfaults (cloudflare/workerd#5977). Fixed forward-only in `8c6080aa…` (tests only — `tests/helpers/local-d1-worker.mjs` recycles workerd before the cache overflows; no migration/catalog/runtime change). A second blocker on the docs heads — vitest worker `onTaskUpdate` RPC timeout after all 3913 tests passed — is fixed forward-only by `tests/helpers/vitest-event-loop-yield.ts` (setupFiles yield per test; test config only). Exact final head + hosted exact-head validate SUCCESS are bound in the PR #25 final certification receipt. 0036 `04228788…` unchanged; legacy fingerprint `9ae153e64…`; `ALL_RECIPES` still 71.

Classification: `T14F_DEVELOPMENT_COMPLETE` · `T14F_REAL_CATALOG_500_COMPLETE` · `T14F_500_AUTHORITY_CERTIFIED` · `T14F_C_CLOSED` · `PRODUCTION_ROLLOUT_DEFERRED` · `MEDIA_POPULATION_DEFERRED` · `T14G_NOT_STARTED`. P0/P1/blocking-P2 = 0; P3 = 1 (unpaginated ~780 KB `/recipes` at 500 — T14G). **Production does not contain 500 recipes** (still at its own migration tip, static authority). PR #25 is **ready for review, unmerged**; merge, production rollout, media population and T14G each require separate authorization. `recipe-catalog/T14F_C_WIP_HANDOFF.md` is historical only.

### T14F-A — T14F_PILOT_CERTIFIED / T14F_SCALE_NOT_STARTED (certified earlier)

auto-fix subscribed. Inspected inherited test-only `8079a37`; verification commit
`2ee6f5cc0e144e5c522ce91bd005ab61dc124ed5` adds explicit source/fallback/cache and cleanup assertions.
Reproduced original routing failures 5/7 at `585e718f…`: historical 71 fixture vs real 101
manifest correctly yields COUNT_DRIFT/static/no cache. The fix generates a file-local legacy
release via the real composer. No production readiness/runtime, pilot, manifest, or migration change.

Routing 8/8, growth 21/21, combined 29/29 twice, subsystem regressions 12 files / 383 tests PASS.
Independent non-isolated combined run also 29/29; review found no P0/P1/P2 blocker.

Exact implementation CI **35223589293 / validate 105209475052 SUCCESS**.
Final documentation-head certification is bound by the [final receipt](https://github.com/frigo-4/Frigo-dev/pull/25#issuecomment-5714709031);
it is not a valid T14F-B base until that receipt records the exact final SHA and CI SUCCESS.

Pilot 30 + static 71 = release 101/1 batch; complete 101, order 0..100; reader 5 statements,
cache hit 0, no N+1. Fresh/staged replay, authority modes and imported HTTP flows PASS.
Next: **STOP.** T14F-B requires separate authorization and the receipt's final certified head.
No ingredient scale preflight, Batch B, 0037, 500 manifest, production/media/T14G action.
Exact commands/hashes: `recipe-catalog/T14F_NEXT_HANDOFF.md`; prior failures remain historical below.
Pre-existing `.hoplite/settings.json` delta remains untouched and uncommitted.

## T14F — WIP SAFE STOP on branch `feat/t14f-recipe-catalog-500`; pilot compiled + promoted; NOT certified; Batch B not started (2026-09-17)

Safe-stop checkpoint per `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T14F_WIP_HANDOFF.md`. Pilot batch `t14f-pilot-30-v1`
(30 original `ai_generated` recipes, source namespace `frigo.t14f.original.v1`) compiled via T14E:
30/30 valid/reviewed/publishable, 0 duplicates, 0 unresolved ingredients; `0036_recipe_catalog_pilot.sql`
promoted byte-identical to the compiler artifact (sha256 `04228788…20ba9`); shipped manifest regenerated
to `rel-193ac2b16c64a260` = 101 recipes / 1 approved batch, legacy fingerprint unchanged. `ALL_RECIPES`
still 71; migrations 36 / tip 0036; 0001–0035 hash drift 0. Executed checks: typecheck, `check:migrations`,
seed check, import check, `git diff --check` all PASS; focused growth suites 20/21 — the
`production forward path 0034 → 0035 → growth` test fails when both growth suites run together and passes
alone (root cause not diagnosed; suspect test isolation). Full gates (lint, build, full `pnpm test`, bundle
accounting) NOT run; Batch B (399) NOT started; no PR; no production action. Do NOT mark pilot certified
or start Batch B before fixing that test failure.

## T14E remediation — review P1/P2/P3 closed on the feature branch; PR #23 re-review pending (2026-09-17)

Forward commit on the T14E branch (old head `7b4edcc8…` kept). **P1 nutrition evidence** now survives end-to-end:
`NormalizedImportRecipe.nutritionEvidence` (macros + `evidence` + ADR-004 `sourceType`, default `imported`) → `normalized-recipes.json`
→ canonical batch projection → generated SQL persists one per-serving `nutrition_profiles` row `<recipe-id>_nutrition_v1`
(`source_reference` = evidence) linked via `recipe_nutrition` at version 1, alongside the legacy compatibility macros; compiler guard
`NUTRITION_EVIDENCE_LOST` + renderer invariant make macros-without-evidence impossible. **P2 immutable batch hash**:
`canonicalBatchProjection` (single function for compile/verify/composition/CLI) commits to schemaVersion, batchId, sourceType/
namespace/reference, license, usageNote and per recipe batchOrder/sourceKey/runtime/provenance/classifications/nutritionEvidence/
duplicateReview; license/usageNote/evidence/review-reason changes ⇒ new `batchHash` ⇒ new `releaseId` (runtime fingerprint unchanged);
row order/whitespace/key order irrelevant; mutated approved batch ⇒ `BATCH_COLLISION`; `verify` detects source metadata mutation.

`4ed98514…`. Status `T14C_PRODUCTION_MIGRATION_BLOCKED` (credentials), not `T14C_COMPLETE`. Runbook and
receipt: `recipe-catalog/T14C_MERGE_RECEIPT.md`. Recipe authority remains `ALL_RECIPES`; T14D/T14E not started.

## T14C — Recipe Media Layer — development history (`feat/t14c-recipe-media-layer`, 2026-09-16)

Base `8d3ebc444bbaa577893dd88a9d21f308a24f0cf5` (T14C_CANONICAL_BASE_MAIN). Adds migration
`0035_recipe_media_layer.sql` (rendered by `renderRecipeMediaLayerSql`; `recipe_media` with closed
role/status/source vocabularies, `UNIQUE(recipe_id, role, version)`, partial-unique current-ready index,
ready invariant, storage-key/MIME CHECKs, immutable-ready trigger, 71 truthful `pending` hero slots),
`packages/recipes/src/recipe-media.ts` (types, `buildRecipeMediaStorageKey`, `resolveRecipeMedia`
precedence canonical_r2 → legacy_static → legacy_external → missing), `packages/db/src/recipe-media.ts`
(`D1RecipeMediaCatalog` bulk IN-chunk reads — no N+1; stage/promote/reject write helpers),
`src/worker/routes/recipe-media.ts` (public read-only `GET|HEAD /api/v1/recipe-media/:id/:role/:version`,
D1-trusted key only, allow-listed MIME, immutable cache + ETag), additive `media.hero` on `/recipes`,
`/recipes/:id`, `/recommendations` attached AFTER filtering/ranking, and `src/web/lib/recipe-media.ts`
as the single frontend fallback point for all 7 image surfaces. 0034 is now pinned in the hash manifest.
Schema gate/migration smoke extended to 0035. ADR-025; design `recipe-catalog/T14C_RECIPE_MEDIA_LAYER.md`.
**Recipe authority remains `ALL_RECIPES`; no `d1` mode; production D1 stays at 0034; no production R2
write; no deployment; PR not merged (independent review required).** Media audit: 71 recipes, 45 unique
refs, 59 external (Unsplash, CSP-blocked), 12 same-origin (1 missing asset gl-11), 20 duplicate refs,
prompts 59/71. Status: see HANDOFF for the exact-head CI receipt.
**Independent-review remediation (same branch, forward commit):** `promoteRecipeMediaVersion` now takes the
R2 binding and verifies the object (exists, exact MIME, exact size, SHA-256 of actual bytes) before the
atomic D1 promotion; 0035 (still the only new migration, no 0036) now requires `content_length` for ready
and enforces the exact deterministic `storage_key` via `CASE mime_type`; `auditReadyRecipeMediaRecord`
reports `missing_content_length`. Production D1 remains 0034; nothing deployed; PR #17 not merged.

## T14B-B — COMPLETE: production D1 0034 applied, Worker deployed — 2026-09-16

Status `T14B_B_COMPLETE`. Production D1 `frigo-db` (`f975ec39-…`) ledger tip is now
`0034_global_recipe_catalog_parity.sql` (34 rows; applied after export backup SHA-256
`ab082dd4…343c`); certified 71/59/12 recipes, 385 ingredients, 341 steps, 71 runtime-field rows
(`runtime_order` 0..70 unique), 385 contiguous ingredient ordinals, `foreign_key_check=[]`,
`quick_check=ok`, remote schema gate PASS, zero drift in non-recipe aggregates.
GitHub environments `staging`/`production` now hold `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`/`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
(production has a required-reviewer gate); Deploy staging run 35101845374 SUCCESS, production run
35102115354 SUCCESS (owner-approved). Production Worker version `56979cb5-e1a8-4241-8a4c-2432d41cc439`
serves `4ed98514f65ddd3b3d83007cd726fd7c2e2136e6`; readiness reports `commit=4ed98514…`, recipes 71/59/12 in
static order, auth config 200, CORS preflight 204. Pre-existing `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING`
warning unchanged. Recipe authority remains static `ALL_RECIPES` (`RECIPE_CATALOG_MODE` unset; no `d1` mode).
Evidence: `recipe-catalog/T14B_B_FINAL_COMPLETION.md`. T14C: `READY_TO_START`, not started —
`recipe-catalog/T14C_HANDOFF.md`; `T14C_CANONICAL_BASE_MAIN` = the merge SHA of this docs PR (recorded in
its post-merge comment). The section below ("blocked by existing OPS secret") is historical.

## T14B-B — MERGED to canonical main 2026-09-16; production rollout blocked by existing OPS secret

Canonical main is now `c7455160bfc8d279d38bc7ca4c0751542012a3c5` (merge of PR #14 head `004e5a32…`
onto `c1c1c14a…`; normal merge commit; exact-head main `validate` SUCCESS run 35072991882; fresh
main gates green, 157 files / 3704 tests). Production D1 `frigo-db` has **not** yet received 0034 and
the production Worker still runs the pre-T14B-B lineage: the automatic Deploy (run 35073197948)
failed at the staging step because `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is not configured in the GitHub `staging`
environment (`T14B_B_PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_BLOCKED_BY_EXISTING_OPS_SECRET`), and this session had no
Cloudflare credentials to apply the migration. Status `T14B_B_ROLLOUT_BLOCKED`; T14C not started.
Receipt: `recipe-catalog/T14B_B_MERGE_RECEIPT.md`.

## T14B-B — D1 catalog parity, runtime view & shadow foundation — 2026-09-16 (merged; details)

Branch from exact canonical main `c1c1c14a2a7dccc883f1030d0dee7043754fb4a9` (repository
`vn-clo/Frigo-dev`, ID `1368281478`, protected). Migration
`0034_global_recipe_catalog_parity.sql` (SHA-256 `23f35645…ada4d`, re-rendered in place during
review remediation — unmerged, no 0035) seeds the 12 static-only global recipes `gl-01..gl-12`
under their stable IDs/slugs and adds `recipe_runtime_fields` (canonical `runtime_order` 0..70
UNIQUE; `category` = typed **open** non-empty string; `region` = **closed** vocabulary
`bac|trung|nam|toan_quoc`; legacy nutrition compatibility macros) plus
`recipe_runtime_ingredient_order` (explicit 0-based ingredient ordinal, `UNIQUE(recipe_id,
position)`, 385 rows). Fresh local replay: `recipes=71`, `recipe_ingredients=385`,
`recipe_steps=341`, `recipe_runtime_fields=71`, `recipe_runtime_ingredient_order=385`,
`recipe_classifications=0`, `recipe_nutrition=0`; drift `staticOnly=[] d1Only=[]
orderDrift=0` and every core/requirement/unit/step/tag/media dimension `[]`; nutrition
`legacy_compatibility`; classification `typed_runtime_field`. Migrations `0001–0033` are
hash-identical to a fixed manifest pinned from `c1c1c14a…`.

Catalog order is behaviourally significant and persisted: `StaticRuntimeRecipeCatalog`
preserves `ALL_RECIPES` order, `D1RuntimeRecipeCatalog` reproduces it independently from
`runtime_order`, and behavioural parity (recommendation, tie-sensitive ranking, planner
generate/regenerate/tie, >5-alternative swap + executed swap, shadow health) is proved on the
**actual** D1 catalog output with no test-side reordering and reversed-catalog negative controls.

`hydrateRuntimeRecipes` (fail-closed) + `StaticRuntimeRecipeCatalog`/`D1RuntimeRecipeCatalog` +
`compareRuntimeCatalogs` give a D1 runtime view that is `toStrictEqual` to all 71 static
recipes; recommendation, planner generate/regenerate/swap and cooking (`gl-03`, `vn-canh-01`)
are proved identical on the hydrated view. **User-visible authority remains `ALL_RECIPES`.**
`RECIPE_CATALOG_MODE` = `static` (default) | `shadow` (off-response comparison, at most one per
isolate per `RECIPE_CATALOG_SHADOW_INTERVAL_MS`, PII-free diagnostic); no `d1` mode exists;
production config rejects non-static.
`SNAPSHOT_POLICY=IMMUTABLE_PAYLOAD_AUTHORITATIVE`; media `DEFERRED_TO_T14C`; cuisine taxonomy
deferred; Inventory Truth, Qwen, PayOS untouched; no production D1/deploy. Details and
evidence: `recipe-catalog/T14B_B_D1_PARITY_SHADOW.md`, ADR-024. PR #14 open against `main`;
exact-head hosted `validate` recorded there.

## Current T14 integration refresh — 2026-09-15 UTC

Canonical repository: `vn-clo/Frigo-dev` (ID `1368281478`). Verified main before
this docs-only receipt: `a165474a623a8130c9a9ed4f1df096b3ac3b3ae9`; not the historical T14 audit base
`345cecf`. PR #9 merged as `911db7fdddcd60ea1e3f3c17b4aed3f4b922bda5`;
PR #10 is its docs-only rollout receipt. Recorded production Worker version
`20bc1f35-6ffe-4085-ba79-d54a0b53da71` serves the custom domain at 100%.
Auth GIS popup, OCR pending UX and SPA/API COOP fixes are preserved. The old
`e6b9195` production baseline below is historical, not current release authority.

T14A audit knowledge is reconciled in
`recipe-catalog/T14A_PRODUCTION_RECIPE_TRUTH_AUDIT.md`; recipe architecture and
migrations were unchanged by PR #9/#10. Fresh frozen install, lint, typecheck,
test (151 files / 3633 tests), migration smoke, build and diff check passed;
all 33 migration hashes match. T14A merged through PR #11 after exact-head
`e916d292d391ba999bcdd96bfdfec98e6b598678` passed hosted run `35034318031`.
Accepted T14B-A source PR #8 is now **merged through PR #12** as `a165474a`.
Exact integration head `3e3937419b560f1ebf0aa7f5e29a3131508b7d94` passed hosted
run `35035112092` and all fresh local gates (154 files / 3676 tests). Its 15
functional paths are unchanged from the accepted source; recipe ADR-023 preserves
Auth ADR-022. All PR #9 files, 33 migration hashes and inventory authority match.
**T14B-B NOT STARTED**. Authority remains static `ALL_RECIPES` (71 = 59 VN +
12 global); D1 remains shadow, media is deferred to T14C, no 0034 is created.

Post-T14B-A main CI `35035415271` passed. Deploy `35035612637` has release success,
staging failure from missing `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, production skipped. This is
an OPS/RELEASE blocker, not T14. PR #4 remains open; **CLOSE_ARCHIVE** is the
recommended disposition, not merge. No deployment or production mutation here.
The RuntimeRecipe contract, completeness/FK-stub classifier, read-only D1 content
projection, drift audit and hardened seed renderer remain non-authoritative.
Fresh local replay: D1 complete 59, static-only `gl-01..gl-12`, d1-only/incomplete/
rejected empty, supported-field drift zero, nutrition `unsupported_by_catalog_model`.
Both integration prerequisites are complete (**READY_FOR_T14B_B**); no new task
is started. The receipt PR's post-merge comment records exact final main and
`T14B_B_BASE_MAIN` after this docs-only receipt, which cannot embed its own merge SHA.
Exact checks, status and next action: `recipe-catalog/T14_INTEGRATION_REFRESH.md`.

# Historical checkpoints — superseded as current-state and next-action authority

The original receipts below are retained, including their then-current SHAs,
test totals and “not started” statements. Use the refresh above for current truth.

## Auth/OCR production hardening checkpoint — 2026-09-16

Branch `codex/auth-ocr-production-fix` contains a focused production fix for
the auth/OCR issues observed on the live Takosan screen. The credential-less
`Đăng nhập nhanh với Google` fallback was removed; Google Identity Services now
waits for the async SDK, initializes once, and exposes an honest retry state if
the provider script is unavailable. The backend's strict Google credential and
audience checks were not changed.

Scan, fridge review and receipt review now share `ScanProcessingState`, showing
received/queued/analyzing/validating/review stages, elapsed time and a clear
promise that results appear only after server processing completes. Existing
`pending`/`processing`/`ready`/`confirmed`/`failed` contracts and polling remain
unchanged.

Verification on this branch: focused auth/OCR `54/54`; full Vitest `3632/3632`
across 151 files; `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:migrations`,
`pnpm build`, and `git diff --check` passed. No production deployment, remote
migration, secret/configuration change, PayOS change or production resource
mutation was performed. Next action: browser smoke on the exact branch/PR,
then hosted CI and maintainer review before any release.

## Production rollout receipt — 2026-09-15

The previously blocked rolling-schema release was completed with explicit
operator authorization. Production D1 `frigo-db` now reports the complete
`0001`-`0033` ledger; `pnpm schema:check:remote` passed, including inventory
authority, scan evidence retention/completeness and foreign-key checks. The
pre-migration SQL export is `/tmp/frigo-prod-pre0032-20260916.sql` with SHA-256
`378c023b15c159d140162e6eb74bbf2ad584e7b699c72384379119defe6dec6a`.

Compatibility Worker `64ee9ed1d986a5e521598a36656e9c2f59d682ee` was deployed
first, then canonical Worker `e6b91956484589c088e6d04a9835b3e59a2eb786` was
deployed to the production custom domain. Readiness now reports the exact
canonical SHA with `database=ok`, `queue=ok`, `ai=configured`,
`config.ok=true`; the only issue is the pre-existing warning
`CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING`. Public health, recipes, manifest/Takosan
branding and unauthenticated mutation boundaries returned expected responses.

Remote SQL API ad-hoc `PRAGMA` queries returned Cloudflare `SQLITE_AUTH`; the
repository-owned remote schema gate is the accepted read-only evidence. No
production KV/R2/queue data was mutated, and no PayOS, DNS, secret rotation or
T14 work occurred. PR #4 (`release/pre0032-schema-compat`) remains open with
no hosted checks; it must be reviewed/merged before the compatibility code is
considered part of canonical `main`.

## Canonical repository consolidation

**CANONICAL REPOSITORY CONSOLIDATION COMPLETE.** The canonical repository is
`vn-dlo/Frigo-dev` (ID `1368281478`), and `main` is
`a5cfb14cfd5840be23eb16b26a3689f5e2d6e805`. PR #2 merged reviewed head
`7ede92c73a41da24500746fd0eded892689d8558` using a history-preserving merge
commit; its tree matches the reviewed head exactly. The immutable application
freeze remains `5f6853d0ed11415871dca0fd31d4981d60518310`; `e34ed167` is
historical and superseded.

Exact PR CI run `34972891435` and post-merge main CI run `34973522150` passed.
Branch protection requires strict `validate`, blocks force-push and deletion,
enforces admins, and retains the maintainer-authorized approval count of zero.
The rollback pointer preserves old main `d1b06732` at
`archive/pre-canonical-consolidation`.

## Maintainer review acceptance

`EXTERNAL_TECHNICAL_REVIEW=APPROVED` for final reviewed head
`7ede92c73a41da24500746fd0eded892689d8558`, with P0=0, P1=0 and P2=0. The
maintainer explicitly accepts that review as sufficient for this repository
consolidation and may waive only the GitHub-native collaborator approval
requirement. CI, PR, force-push and branch-deletion protections remain active.

## Production deployment status

**ROLLOUT COMPLETE WITH FOLLOW-UP.** Production is serving canonical
`e6b91956484589c088e6d04a9835b3e59a2eb786` and D1 is at migration `0033`.
The compatibility sequencing concern was handled by deploying `64ee9ed1`
before the bridge migration. The remaining follow-up is review/merge of PR #4;
do not down-migrate or bypass branch protection. PayOS, DNS, secret rotation,
production KV/R2/queue data and T14 remain untouched.

# Historical production integration evidence — 2026-09-15

## Historical merger-plan audit — superseded as current authority

**NOT READY TO MERGE OR DEPLOY.** A fresh two-repository/branch/migration audit
is recorded in `docs/integration/CANONICAL_REPOSITORY_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md`;
the separate production rollout risks remain in
`docs/integration/SAFE_PRODUCTION_MERGER_PLAN.md`. Production
`main` already contains adapted frontend upgrade lineage `d270cd4`/`57c88c5`
and platform hardening lineage `3f33d11`; historical tips `fafe1cc`, `2052932`
and `089c406` are not independent cherry-picks. The confirmed migration
collision remains production `0023_scan_request_fingerprint.sql` versus dev
`0023_inventory_truth_foundation.sql`, resolved by immutable production
`0001`-`0023` plus byte-copied T08-T13 `0024`-`0033`.

Qwen task-runtime source `da41686` is 15 commits ahead of and not contained in
production `main`; it remains a required merge source. The fetched history's
additional `0024`-`0032` filename variants are the current integration branch's
`+1` aliases of the same certified dev blobs, not extra migrations.

New release blocker: canonical `0032_scan_evidence_retention.sql` enforces
`review_state`/`is_confirmed` coupling, while the current production Worker
writes only `is_confirmed`. The integrated Worker also assumes the new columns
exist. A schema-capability compatibility release and rolling-upgrade rehearsal
must precede any remote bridge migration. That compatibility release must be
merged/deployed independently, followed by separate Qwen/runtime, T08-T13
bridge, and Takosan brand-only trains; each begins at the prior deployed head.
Current `f26003b` is not production-deployable as-is; canonical repository
promotion still requires the exact lineage, docs-only and hosted-CI gates.
Repository access remains production
`ADMIN` and Frigo-dev `WRITE`. Promotion branch `canonical/5f6853d-promotion`
was published at `f48e830ed9cdde2214ad5b4dbd58b8bc30c06106`, archive pointer
`archive/pre-canonical-consolidation` preserves `d1b06732`, and PR #1 was
closed. PR #2 later completed the canonical merge; no production deploy or
remote database/resource mutation occurred.

Fresh planning-audit checks: repository/API metadata, heads/merge-base/ancestry,
source diff inventories, all-ref migration variants, bridge blob equality,
production/integrated scan SQL inspection, and two real SQLite ordering probes.
Both probes exited `1` with the expected trigger/missing-column failures.
Promotion validation then passed: frozen install, lint, typecheck, migration
smoke, build, `git diff --check`, full Vitest `3630/3630` (149 files), local D1
`92/92` (5 files), and browser `60/60` serial at 360/390/430. Hosted PR checks
have not started/reported yet; branch protection API remains 404.

## Historical remediation state — superseded by the merger-plan audit above

**INDEPENDENT-REVIEW BLOCKERS FIXED AND COMMITTED.** The working branch remains
`integration/t13-takosan-qwen`; remediation candidate is `5f6853d` on base HEAD
`231d1e7`.
The reviewed candidate `e34ed16777166407acf67b2c76d733d89c7d64ca` is
superseded and must not be merged as-is.

Protected payment UI is restored byte-identically to production base
`05423f2`; brand assertions exclude those protected surfaces. The Qwen scan
regression now exercises real router/runtime/provider composition and mocks only
synthetic DashScope HTTP before queue persistence and T13 confirmation.
Missing/0/.11/.9 confidence remains exact evidence; low confidence is retained
for review, while generic labels are rejected. Runtime escalation preserves a
concrete prior error when the next role is disabled. Certified T13 DEC-012 auth
deferral is intentionally retained and documented as an auth difference from
production.

Exact fresh checks: focused `41/41`; broader affected matrix initially `300/302`
because two brand assertions included payment, then brand `16/16`; full Vitest
`3630/3630` in 149 files; `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`,
`pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build`, `git diff --check` PASS; browser `60/60`
at 360/390/430 PASS. No remote or production mutation occurred. Next action:
final review of immutable SHA `5f6853d`.
Two intermediate typecheck attempts exposed an over-generic then invalid
`fetch` spy annotation; `MockInstance<typeof globalThis.fetch>` fixed it and the
final typecheck plus focused `57/57` rerun passed.

Access preflight: `Tungjpstore` has production `ADMIN` and Frigo-dev `WRITE`;
repository IDs/default heads remain verified, with no branch protection or
rulesets reported. Local `origin` points to `Tungjpstore/yaji`, so it is not a
safe implicit publication target for this integration branch.

**HISTORICAL PRE-REVIEW CERTIFICATION — SUPERSEDED BY REMEDIATION ABOVE.** Branch `integration/t13-takosan-qwen` starts at verified
production `PRODUCTION_BASE=05423f2ad675006a4c7913e696f1979b3fcaae59` in
`Tungjpstore/Frigo` (ID `1360256196`). Normal common ancestor with certified
development is `d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa`.
`INTEGRATION_APPLICATION_CANDIDATE=e34ed16777166407acf67b2c76d733d89c7d64ca`.

The candidate combines governed Qwen source `da41686b`, certified T13 freeze
`32ddbb4` / review `9c3c3d3`, and hardened Takosan source `ff63edf`. Production
`0023_scan_request_fingerprint.sql` is byte-identical; ten certified T13
migrations are byte-copied at `0024`-`0033`. Pre-existing production migration
changes `0`; bridge mismatches `0`; 33 unique contiguous migrations. The real
queue path preserves missing/0/.11/.9 evidence, provenance and fingerprint into
T13 confirmation; replay creates no duplicate T09 effects. T09/T11 remain the
mutation/read authorities; unknown writers/readers `0/0`.

Historical candidate gates: frozen install, lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build, diff check
PASS; full Vitest `3628/3628` in 149 files; real local workerd/D1 `92/92` in five
files; browser last and serial `60/60` at 360/390/430. P3-1 and P3-2 remain
unchanged. **NO HOSTED GITHUB CI STATUS FOR INTEGRATION_APPLICATION_CANDIDATE**.
No deploy, main merge, remote D1/R2/KV/queue mutation, PayOS backend change,
secret/DNS change, or T14. Full packet: `docs/integration/`.

# Frigo current state — T13R certified, ready for independent review #2

## Current authoritative state — T13R certified freeze, 2026-09-14

## Historical — T13R-A application checkpoint, 2026-09-13 (superseded)

**T13R-A COMPLETE — READY FOR T13R-B. NOT a final T13 freeze.** Repository
`vn-co3/Frigo-dev` (renamed from `vn-co2`), ID **1368281478**. Branch
`hoplite/oropos-eb2d4886--t13r-a-data-integrity-ownership`;
**T13R_A_APPLICATION_CHECKPOINT=`fc0f9c56c53ae7b17f2d1fb4770a6bc231ebc027`**.
Protected main `d1b06732…` unchanged. Rejected freeze `7b7bb69…` remains
**DO NOT RELEASE** and is the comparison baseline.

All six T13R-A findings are **FIXED** with permanent red→green regressions:
P1-1 async raw evidence (`scan-queue.ts`), P2-A complete raw mapping evidence and
P2-B reviewed-expiry round-trip (additive migration **0032**, sync+async writers,
DTO, both review pages), P1-2 canonical identity preserved under free-form rename
(`inventory.ts` PATCH), P1-3 lot-bound edit drafts (`IngredientDetailPage` keyed by
route + owner check), P1-4 receipt review requires `next.id === receiptScanId`
(`ReceiptReviewPage`). Migrations: **32**; 0001–0031 byte-identical; 0032 additive,
no backfill. Authority audit: inventory writer and T11 reader sets identical to the
freeze; UNKNOWN writers 0, UNKNOWN readers 0; no evidence column is stock authority.

Gates at checkpoint: lint/typecheck/build PASS; **3423/137** full Vitest;
**45/5** focused T13R-A; **92/5** real local D1 (workerd); **42/42** browser
(14 cases × 360/390/430); migration smoke with populated 0031→0032 upgrade; fresh
32-migration local D1 apply; legacy 0031→0032 populated upgrade on real local D1
(0 fabricated rows, FK 0); schema gate PASS. Details, commands and per-finding
tests: [T13R_A_REMEDIATION.md](inventory-truth/t13/T13R_A_REMEDIATION.md).

T13R-B blockers remain OPEN (Cloudflare fridge confidence fabrication, inventory
conflict/refetch UX, Home estimated-expiry qualifier, NULL opened-state truth).
No merge/deploy/remote D1/PayOS/T14/repository reconciliation. `.hoplite/settings.json`
overlay remains uncommitted by rule.

## Historical — T13R-A safe stop, 2026-09-13T15:50:34Z (superseded)

**T13R-A SAFELY CHECKPOINTED BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION.** Repository
`vn-co2/Frigo-dev`, ID **1368281478**. Independent audit `b9735b4` (docs-only,
FAIL verdict) is now remote on `hoplite/oropos-eb2d4886` with verified local/remote
equality; protected main and all rejected-freeze lineage are unchanged. Remediation
branch `hoplite/oropos-eb2d4886--t13r-a-data-integrity-ownership` starts at the
audit commit with an **empty non-doc delta** against the rejected freeze.

No remediation code exists yet: all six target findings (P1-1..P1-4, P2-A, P2-B)
are **NOT STARTED**; `NO_NEW_T13R_A_CODE_COMMIT=true`. Migrations remain 31 with
0031 untouched and no 0032. Cheap checks executed: `git diff --check` PASS; no
TypeScript/source file changed, so typecheck and scoped lint were correctly not
run. The pre-existing `.hoplite/settings.json` overlay stays uncommitted by rule.
Per-finding state, exact commands and resume point:
[T13R_A_REMEDIATION.md](inventory-truth/t13/T13R_A_REMEDIATION.md). Do not claim
T13 complete; next task is T13R-A implementation, then T13R-B blockers.

## Current authoritative state — independent T13 final review, 2026-09-13

**T13 INDEPENDENT FINAL REVIEW — FAIL.** The exact application freeze
`7b7bb695ee597a46cf4022a2c534e2fea374be5d` is not accepted for leaving T13.
Repository ID **1368281478** is verified; the provider now calls the same repo
`vn-co2/Frigo-dev`. Protected main and certified docs head remain unchanged.
Freeze → `4fcbc96b5a5d4b3cea2c2ad0bdb5682b1866891a` has an empty non-doc diff.

Fresh exact-freeze checks PASS: lint/typecheck/build, **3372/132** full,
**194/10** focused, **92/5** real local D1, **36/36** browser at 360/390/430,
migration smoke, all **31** fresh local migrations, legacy upgrade/replay,
local schema and diff checks. Detached status remains empty. Hosted checks and
legacy status contexts for the exact freeze are both absent.

Those gates miss confirmed blockers: **P0 0, P1 4, blocking P2 6**. Async queue
processing omits raw evidence and mishandles absent confidence; U7 can clear
canonical identity and submit a draft to another lot; receipt review accepts a
mismatched scan ID. Additional defects affect confidence, retained review fields,
confirmed expiry, conflict recovery, estimated-date labels and opening-state truth.
Independent local/browser counterexamples are retained; no application fix ran.

See [the independent report](release/T13_INDEPENDENT_FINAL_REVIEW.md) for exact
findings, original AC1–AC14, roadmap closure, commands, failed/inconclusive probes,
and evidence. Earlier COMPLETE/all-PASS statements below are historical and
superseded, not current approval. Next: a new T13 remediation branch for confirmed
blockers, then a new freeze and independent review. No merge/deploy/remote D1/
PayOS/T14/repository reconciliation. This review changed documentation only.

## Current authoritative state — T13 detached certification, 2026-09-13

**T13 COMPLETE — STOP for INDEPENDENT T13 FINAL REVIEW.** Repository
`vn-ca1/Frigo-dev`, ID **1368281478**. Protected main remains
`d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa`.
Continuation: `hoplite/mende-26679a14--browser-harness-final-cert`, started at
`3262eaff86333da142ada1135e5a20c58ea640eb` with application WIP fd32aa8.
Browser-proven U7 metadata correction was committed separately as
`47b10e25d6853a9bc4f9dfcf2e83bc01ba330bf2`.
**T13B_APPLICATION_FREEZE=7b7bb695ee597a46cf4022a2c534e2fea374be5d** was
published, fetched and matched; subsequent changes are documentation only.

The repository-owned Playwright harness removes the Managed Preview dependency:
`pnpm test:browser` owns `node scripts/security-preview.mjs`, with synthetic
in-memory SQLite, blocked external application traffic and no remote bindings.
Pre-freeze and clean-detached browser **36/36** at 360/390/430; full baseline and
detached full suite both **3372/132 files**. Detached focused: T08 **130/2**,
T09 **1259/17**, T10 **98/6**, T11 **39/2**, T12 **22/3**, T13/T13B **271/12**;
current hardening/privacy/operator gate **194/10** (26 hardening, 26 actual CLI).
Fresh real local workerd/D1 **92/5**. Lint/typecheck/build/migration smoke/fresh
local D1 replay/legacy replay/schema/diff PASS; detached status **EMPTY**.
Writer/reader UNKNOWN **0/0**, **31 migrations**, 0031 unchanged/no 0032.
Original AC1–AC14 PASS; R3/R4/R5/R6/R7/R8/R11 and
U1/U4/U6/U7/U8/U12/U13/U14 DONE. P0/P1/blocking P2/unresolved scoped P3: 0.

Failure retained: concurrent detached browser initially passed 35/36 because the
full suite's existing source-writing generator triggered Vite reload during H.
The entire unchanged browser suite then passed 36/36 serially. Run source-writing
checks before browser certification, never alongside it in the same worktree.
HTML report credential leakage was fixed before freeze by removing that reporter
and adding actual lifecycle sanitization coverage. No freeze file changed afterward.
**NO HOSTED GITHUB CI STATUS FOR T13B_APPLICATION_FREEZE**; local gates are not hosted CI.

Exact commands, evidence, resolved failures and next action:
[T13B_FINAL_HARDENING.md](inventory-truth/t13/T13B_FINAL_HARDENING.md).
No main merge/deploy/remote D1/PayOS/T14/repository reconciliation.
All earlier current-state sections below are historical checkpoints, superseded here.

## Current authoritative state — fresh-session Preview safe-stop, 2026-09-13

**T13 NOT COMPLETE — BROWSER VERIFICATION BLOCKED.** Fresh-session public metadata
confirmed `vn-ca1/Frigo-dev`, ID **1368281478**. Trusted refs remain guarded main
`d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa` and continuation
`hoplite/kos-9d39545d--t13b-b-final-certification` at
`a9b5904aeba0fc7e4d649165770a4e86701312a2`; fresh branch `hoplite/mende-26679a14` started at the
same SHA with an empty status/diff. The required ancestry
`2334a6f -> c37a9b8 -> f845d04 -> fd32aa8 -> a9b5904` and the empty non-doc delta
from `fd32aa8` to `a9b5904` were reverified.

The effective isolated run is `node scripts/security-preview.mjs`; no settings,
scripts, application code, tests, or final T13 documents changed. Three schema-valid
managed-Preview attempts (`preview`, 120 seconds, promotion `preview:3000`) failed
before harness startup with: `Preview port must be a currently discovered HTTP
listener owned by the managed preview run`. Port 3000 is the harness default, but
no managed harness listener existed; `sandbox_ports` showed only browser processes.
No ad-hoc server or unsupported workaround was used.

Flows A–I and widths 360/390/430 are **NOT RUN**; real viewport-emulation capability
was not tested. No current focused/full/type/lint/build/D1/migration-replay/schema/authority
audit ran. Historical 176/9 and 26 hardening/adoption results remain historical only;
`CURRENT_FULL_TEST_COUNT` and `CURRENT_FULL_FILE_COUNT` are not established. No defect,
freeze, final docs head, merge, deploy, remote D1, PayOS, or T14 work is claimed.
Migration integrity passed: 31 tracked migrations, unchanged 0031, no 0032; replay is
not certified. `git diff --check` passed. The platform fault was reported and recorded.
Next: repair the supported managed Preview interface, then resume the mandatory WIP
browser flows before baseline, acceptance closure, freeze, and independent review.

## Current authoritative state — confirmed-review UX WIP, 2026-09-13 12:40 UTC

**T13 NOT COMPLETE — BROWSER VERIFICATION BLOCKED.** New continuation branch
`hoplite/kos-9d39545d--t13b-b-final-certification` starts exactly at f845d04; prior
WIP branch and guarded main are unchanged. Repository ID 1368281478 and canonical
`vn-ca1/Frigo-dev`/historical redirect were freshly verified.
Published application WIP: `fd32aa8deaee7df454245591015780c59f909352` (not freeze).
Confirmed scans now show completed/read-only wording, hide manual addition and
replace the confirm CTA with `Xem tủ lạnh`; terminal remount/privacy guards remain.
PASS: **176 tests/9 files**, including **26 hardening** and **26 actual operator**
tests; typecheck, scoped lint, diff check. All 31 migrations unchanged/no 0032.
One fresh managed Preview attempt reproduced the mandatory-promotion platform
error; no existing isolated server was available. Reported again; stopped before
freeze per owner instruction. No browser/full-suite baseline/final certification
was fabricated. Required next baseline is the actual current runtime count, **not**
historical 3177/124. See the latest `inventory-truth/t13/T13B_B_WIP_HANDOFF.md`
section for exact checks and resume gates. No settings commit/merge/deploy/remote D1/PayOS.

## Current authoritative state — T13B-B hardening WIP, 2026-09-13

**T13 NOT COMPLETE — browser/final certification blocked.** Current repository is
`vn-ca1/Frigo-dev`, ID **1368281478**; historical `Tungjpstore/Frigo-dev` redirects to
that same ID. All guarded SHAs/ancestry passed; continuation starts exactly at
`2334a6f41cf68d42ae1eba7a30440b8fe324eb31`, never main.
Branch: `hoplite/kos-9d39545d--t13b-b-final-hardening`.
Published application-bearing **WIP**, not freeze:
`c37a9b8d7afc66507052bbc8f1e8a24fdc896e8d` (fetched remote equality verified).
Route/store ownership, private-session async fencing, fridge domain-error recovery,
and confirmed-review status retention are fixed with **23 new regressions**.
Final focused **173/173 (9 files)**; T13B-A backend **1122/1122 (17 files)**;
typecheck, scoped lint, operator syntax and diff check PASS. Migration count 31,
0031 unchanged/no 0032; current-source writer/reader UNKNOWN 0/0.
Managed Preview is blocked by its mandatory promotion schema; no browser/final
detached/full-suite/D1/schema/build certification or application freeze is claimed.
Full evidence, corrected intermediate check failures, transfer/docs-lineage proof
and exact next action: [T13B_B_WIP_HANDOFF.md](inventory-truth/t13/T13B_B_WIP_HANDOFF.md).
Main remains `d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa`; no merge/deploy/remote D1/PayOS.

## Current authoritative state — T13B-B quota-safe WIP, 2026-09-13

Implementation stopped on the owner's instruction. The focused Part B preflight
completed **109/109 tests in 6 files**; full/frozen verification and final acceptance
are not complete. Initial 404/fetch failures were followed by successful broker
publication/fetch equality for WIP `a8cefd13505bc6b45dd11f45a6323539deb60f93`;
main was reverified unchanged. Fresh public numeric metadata still returns 404.
Actual branch base is `c31567ec7dfa8f95808c20c834b327cbb3425f9c`, not the
safe-stop expected documentation base `69b0dc676fcb4136861a8ca0c66994259eba5116`.
Read [T13B_B_WIP_HANDOFF.md](inventory-truth/t13/T13B_B_WIP_HANDOFF.md) for changed
files, executed checks, pending review, migration status and exact resumption steps.
No further implementation, main merge, deployment or remote D1 work is authorized.

## Current authoritative state — T13B-A backend checkpoint, 2026-09-13

**T13B-A COMPLETE — READY FOR T13B-B.** This is backend-only continuation,
not final T13 certification. The older T13 completion claim below is historical.
Repository ID **1364064929**, current owner/name **vn-2l/frigo-dev**; branch
`hoplite/megara-hyblaia-888f1514`, exact base `3458c6cb971f5d96fce8eda3abc3d708437ce713`.
Main remains `d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa`; no merge/rebase/deploy.

**T13B_A_CHECKPOINT=c31567ec7dfa8f95808c20c834b327cbb3425f9c** was committed,
published without force, fetched and verified equal to the remote branch.
Documentation follows separately; this is not a final application freeze.

Adopted receipts create one new T09 RECEIPT lot per accepted line, preserving old
manual/receipt lots and separate purchase facts, storage and expiry. Fridge SCAN
retains grouped CORRECT addition. Raw/confirmed correction evidence is validated
command intent in the existing receipt fingerprint and event metadata fingerprint;
`correctionOf()` is used in production. T10 rawName uses retained OCR, not the
reviewed name; absent raw stays null with a real subject identity. Concurrent and
post-commit response-loss attempts recover through scoped confirmed-status replay,
without repeating stock writes. Review/observation/command/status atomicity remains.

Executed: focused backend **1,122/1,122 (17 files)**; real local D1 **92/92
(5 files; 11 new)**; `pnpm typecheck`; scoped ESLint on all six changed code/test
files; `git diff --check`, scope/ancestry/migration checks — PASS. Four new regressions
fail on the exact pre-fix base as expected. Full commands, initial failures and fixes:
`inventory-truth/t13/T13B_A_HANDOFF.md`. In particular, the initial D1 race failure
(91/92) was fixed rather than weakening its both-success/exactly-once assertions.

Migration count **31**; 0001–0031 unchanged, no 0032. Focused writer UNKNOWN **0**,
canonical reader UNKNOWN **0**; T09/T11 authority unchanged. No frontend, protected
payment/auth, Week, setup or infrastructure change.

**NOT RUN — DEFERRED TO T13B-B FINAL VERIFICATION:** full application suite,
full lint/build, dedicated migration smoke/schema/upgrade gates, browser/mobile
checks, receipt/scan UX and adoption path, final T13 matrix/certification.
Next: continue from the published documentation HEAD with this exact application
checkpoint, following `T13B_A_HANDOFF.md` and DEC-016; do not start from main.

## Current authoritative state — T13 Receipt/Vision Truth & Inventory UX V2, 2026-09-13

**Verdict: T13 IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED on branch `hoplite/lindos-0368e413`; NOT merged to
main.** Repository ID 1364064929 (`vn-2i/frigo-dev`); `origin/main` still `d1b0673` (NOT
advanced). Base commit `578f705` (ROADMAP_AUDIT_HEAD). `T13_APPLICATION_FREEZE` =
`ad342703fb31a2b97d2798f1161fb83d4d0ed090`.

Scope closed: receipt/vision provenance truth (RECEIPT vs SCAN from server-side `scan_type`
only), purchase facts (real merchant/date/price or absent), truthful expiry kind
(KNOWN/ESTIMATED/UNKNOWN in distinct columns), raw-vs-confirmed OCR evidence retention,
T10 observation integration inside the existing atomic batch, additive read/decision routes,
and the Inventory UX V2 surfaces (lot detail + provenance, edit/MOVE, receipt review with
real confidence/price/date and per-line rejection, reconciliation page).

Migration `0031_scan_evidence_retention.sql` is additive only (adds `ocr_raw_name`,
`ocr_quantity`, `ocr_unit`, `ocr_confidence`, `review_state` to `scan_items` with
insert/update triggers coupling `review_state` and `is_confirmed`). Migrations 0001-0030
untouched. Fresh 0001→0031 replay and legacy-upgrade replay both PASS.

Authority unchanged: **exactly one inventory writer (T09)**. T13 adds exactly one new write
statement — a guarded INSERT into `inventory_observations` that rides the existing atomic
batch and writes evidence, not stock. Zero new writes to `inventory_lots`, `inventory_items`
or `inventory_events`; zero new `inventory_items` readers. Writer/reader audits UNKNOWN = 0.

Executed checks (clean detached worktree @ `ad34270`, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`):
full suite **3,177/3,177 across 124 files**; real D1 **81/81**; lint, typecheck, build,
`check:migrations` (`migration-smoke=ok`), `schema:check:local`, `git diff --check` all PASS;
`git status --porcelain` empty. Baseline before T13 was 3,092/120 and 70 real-D1.

Browser verification against the isolated preview (`scripts/security-preview.mjs`, in-memory
SQLite, `AI_MOCK_MODE`, external fetch disabled) found **7 defects that a fully green test
suite had not caught**, including a lot-id collision that made every line of one receipt
share a single lot id, and two identifier-bound errors that made every real receipt
observation permanently undecidable. All seven are fixed with permanent regression tests.

Main NOT merged; nothing deployed; remote D1 NOT touched; PayOS untouched;
`MEAL_PLANNER_ENABLED` and cutover flags unchanged.

## Current authoritative state — Roadmap reconciliation / gap audit of RC 64c5501, 2026-09-12

**Verdict: T13 REQUIRED** (receipt: `docs/ai/release/INVENTORY_TRUTH_ROADMAP_RECONCILIATION.md`;
scope definition only: `docs/ai/release/T13_PROPOSED_SCOPE.md`). Repository ID 1364064929
(now `vn-2g/frigo-dev`); `origin/main` still `d1b0673` (NOT advanced). Audit branch
`hoplite/delphoi-499ad774` (requested logical name `hoplite/inventory-truth-roadmap-reconciliation`)
created at exact re-certification docs HEAD `1cae11e`; application tree = certified RC
`64c5501` (docs-only delta verified). Roadmap mismatch **CONFIRMED**: pre-implementation
sources `MASTER_CONTEXT.md@43718c2` and `tasks/T08-…@b5577ea` define T11 = "receipt/vision
truth and inventory UX V2"; implemented T11 = read authority (assigned to T12 by the T09
packet); T11 continuation handed the scope to T12; T12 never addressed it; no DEC/ADR
supersedes it. Matrix: Receipt/Vision R1–R12 = DONE 5 / PARTIAL 2 / MISSING 5; UX V2
U1–U17 = DONE 4 / PARTIAL 9 / MISSING 4; SUPERSEDED/OUT_OF_SCOPE 0. Release safety of
`64c5501` unchanged: P0/P1/P2 = 0; P3 notes — inferred shelf-life/day-chip expiry written
as `expiryKind:'KNOWN'` (DEC-003 conflict), Cloudflare provider fabricates defaults,
`FINAL_WRITER_MAP` scan row overstates changed-payload conflict, pre-existing outbox
head-of-line block on permanent 409. Actual receipt pipeline = pre-T08 legacy scan
draft → user confirm → T09 adapter with `sourceType:'SCAN'` (no `RECEIPT` lots, no
observation integration, price/date dropped, no reconciliation/lot/provenance UX,
`POST /inventory/adopt` has no product caller). Executed checks (clean worktree @ `64c5501`):
targeted vitest 55/55 (5 files) + a temporary uncommitted probe (4/4, deleted). Main NOT
merged; nothing deployed; remote D1 NOT touched; PayOS untouched; no application change.

## Current authoritative state — Independent final re-certification of RC 64c5501, 2026-09-12

**Verdict: RELEASE CANDIDATE `64c5501ab0110658718b3752bd84e537f0854e12` TECHNICALLY

16/16 ancestors, no rewrite; remediation delta exactly the six D3/D1 files; D3 code,
tests (A–L incl. route boundary), negative control (3/6 fail on pre-fix AuthPage) and
browser reproduction re-verified; D1 blob `3818a00` byte-identical to main; D2
SAFE_DEFERRED with `MEAL_PLANNER_AUTHORITY_CUTOVER`; fresh reader/writer audits
UNKNOWN = 0 (sets identical to `d156001`); no second ledger; task survival by tree
comparison PASS. Clean detached checkout @ `64c5501`: install frozen (lockfile unchanged);

## Current authoritative state — Final Release Integration Review (T08→T12), 2026-09-12

**Verdict: RELEASE CANDIDATE NOT READY** (docs: `docs/ai/release/INVENTORY_TRUTH_RELEASE_CERTIFICATION.md`,
`INVENTORY_TRUTH_ANCESTRY.md`, `INVENTORY_TRUTH_CHANGE_MANIFEST.md`). Reviewed from
exact docs HEAD `5cb4caa0d5b3c86b00954d77cd40b16027c21df1`; application RC

## Current authoritative state — T12 closed-loop runtime verification, 2026-09-12

**New T12 application freeze: `d15600186c3e73faba011eb690ac6cd70e8d3d2d`** — `fix(t12): complete
closed-loop runtime verification` — published/fetched (direct publication, no
PR tooling), local == remote == clean-checkout SHA; `22f675d` superseded.
Closed the independent-review gaps: P1 real workerd/D1 closed-loop suite (8
cases; real D1 62 → 70), P2 route-level proof through the real Hono handlers
(`POST /week/plans/:id/shopping/complete`, `POST /recipes/:id/cook/complete`,
`GET /inventory`; 5 tests, stale KV injected), P2 reconciliation-vs-manual race
now requires the explicit `STALE_SNAPSHOT` loser (no `PERSISTENCE_FAILED`).
Route fix surfaced by the proof: adopted cook replays its durable receipt before
re-planning (response-loss retry → replay, not INSUFFICIENT_INVENTORY). Gates:
full 3,085/3,085 across 119 files; T09 654; T10 98; T11 39; T12 22; real D1
70/70; lint/typecheck/build/30-migration smoke/schema/diff PASS — repeated from
the clean detached exact-SHA checkout with empty status. UNKNOWN readers/writers

## Historical T12 state — first freeze 22f675d (superseded)

**T12 application freeze: `22f675d1cca76d05c93ebb2ed40bbaea11a72238`** — `feat(t12): close the inventory truth
loop` — the final Inventory Truth release-train task. The loop
evidence → observation → reconciliation → T09 command authority →
inventory_lots → T11 read authority → consumers is closed and proven by a
permanent 9-test closed-loop suite (E2E reconciliation exactly-once, DISMISS
inert, recipe/planner/shopping/cook/notification loops, single-winner races,
drift matrix). Display aliases tightened: tampered projection rows drop to
canonical presentation. FINAL_AUTHORITY_MAP/FINAL_WRITER_MAP: UNKNOWN
production readers/writers = 0. Gates: full 3,072/3,072 across 117 files; real
D1 62/62; all static/30-migration/schema gates PASS. No migration; no new
writers. Main NOT merged; production NOT deployed; remote D1 NOT touched;
PayOS untouched; **release train T08–T12 COMPLETE**.

## Historical T12 baseline state — T11 hardening (superseded by T12)

**New T11 application freeze: `c15c9a81fc4367b3506a7e2693798ebe1424b0a9`** — `fix(t11): complete read
authority runtime hardening` — published/fetched (direct commit publication,
no PR tooling), local == remote == clean-checkout SHA; `657201f` superseded.
Closed: real workerd/D1 proof of T11 (11 cases; real D1 51 → 62), adopted-but-
empty regression on integration + real D1 + HTTP (native mode, `[]`, no legacy/
KV/auto-adoption), READ vs MOVE/DISCARD/FEFO barrier coverage (matrix now
CORRECT/MOVE/USE/DISCARD/FEFO/T10), `activeCount` = filtered summary, explicit
kg↔g / l↔ml display-alias compatibility with canonical authority intact, and
fail-closed freshness (`computeReadFreshness`, invalid dates → CORRUPT_LOT_ROW).
Gates: full 3,063/3,063 across 116 files; T09 654/654; T10 98/98; T11 39/39;
real D1 62/62; lint/typecheck/build/30-migration smoke/local schema/diff PASS —
repeated from the clean detached exact-SHA checkout with empty status. Readers/
writers UNKNOWN = 0. No migration. Main NOT merged. Production NOT deployed.
Remote D1 NOT touched. T12 NOT STARTED. **T11 COMPLETE — READY FOR INDEPENDENT
REVIEW.**

## Historical T11 state — first freeze 657201f (superseded)

Branch `hoplite/himera-6d3eda84-t10-observation-reconciliation-t11-inventory-read-authority`
(start_branch successor; base = train merge `30ce4ea` containing exactly the
required T10 docs HEAD `c71692a`). **T11 application freeze: `657201f3a12f18dd96cc96adeac0dd1d3b75e6f4`**
published as **PR #3** (base `hoplite/kydonia-2785bb72` — the release train,
NOT main); corrective `4553b8a` removed the platform auto-committed
workspace overlay (`c7e2296`; overlay preserved byte-for-byte uncommitted).
The T09/T10 truth layer is now the canonical READ authority: adopted
households read `inventory_lots` + validated mapping evidence through
`packages/db/src/inventory-read-authority.ts`; `inventory_items` never decides
truth; no dual-truth fallback; corruption fails closed; reads never write.
Read consumer audit: production UNKNOWN=0 (`docs/ai/inventory-truth/t11/
READ_CONSUMER_MAP.md`). Gates: full 3,041/3,041 across 115 files; real D1
51/51; lint/typecheck/build/30-migration smoke/local schema/diff PASS —
repeated from a clean detached exact-SHA checkout with empty status. No
migration. Main NOT merged. Production NOT deployed. Remote D1 NOT touched.
T12 NOT STARTED. **T11 COMPLETE — READY FOR INDEPENDENT REVIEW.**

## Historical T10 state — observation claim fence (superseded by T11)

Branch `hoplite/himera-6d3eda84-t10-observation-reconciliation`. **New T10 application
freeze: `7393edcd4fb9cc8bb4df2a06628fb5dc57f8607b`** — `fix(t10): atomically fence competing reconciliation
decisions` — published/fetched, local == remote == clean-checkout SHA; `4c414fa` is
superseded (historical ancestor). Reproduced P1: two decision keys racing one OPEN
observation relied on a trigger side effect — the final guarded observation UPDATE with zero
rows is a silent D1 success, losers surfaced raw SQLite errors, and with the 0030 receipt
trigger absent both decisions committed. Fix: an in-batch `changes()` claim guard (T09
write-guard technique) makes a lost OPEN/vN → RECONCILED/vN+1 claim abort the whole atomic
batch (T09 commands, events, projection, receipt, observation all roll back); losers get
`OBSERVATION_VERSION_CONFLICT`; a committed same-key twin replays (response-loss preserved),
altered twin → `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`. 13 regressions (13 fail pre-fix) + 2 real-D1 proofs
incl. a controlled race under workerd. Gates: full 3,024/3,024 across 114 files; T10
focused 98/98; T09 focused 323/323; real local D1 51/51; lint/typecheck/build/30-migration
smoke/local schema/diff PASS — repeated from the clean detached exact-SHA checkout. No
migration. Main NOT merged. Production NOT deployed. Remote D1 NOT touched. T11 NOT STARTED.
Verdict: **T10 PASS — READY FOR INDEPENDENT REVIEW.**

## Historical T10 state — composition fix 4c414fa (superseded by 7393edc)

Branch `hoplite/himera-6d3eda84-t10-observation-reconciliation`.
**New T10 application freeze: `4c414fa7eb33329ee12936c0899644af67e48f07`** — `fix(t10): compose multi-field
reconciliation commands atomically` — published/fetched, local == remote ==
clean-checkout SHA; the previous freeze `6c28858` is superseded (historical ancestor).
Reproduced P1: the planner collected per-dimension proposals independently, so one
lot could receive 2–3 CORRECT proposals (quantity/expiry/openedAt) plus a MOVE, mixed
claims took an expiry-only verdict, and split CORRECTs shared the `<decisionKey>#CORRECT`
client key (idempotency/CAS hazard). Fix: `composeProposals` merges all compatible
CORRECT changes into exactly one CORRECT plus at most one MOVE bound to the matched
lot/version (contradictions → CONFLICT `PROPOSAL_COMPOSITION_CONFLICT`); the decision
boundary independently enforces max one CORRECT / one MOVE / same lot+version / type
consistency and fails closed; CORRECT+MOVE composes through T09 `useCurrentLotVersion`
atomically. 19 permanent regressions (16 fail pre-fix). Gates: full 3,009/3,009 across
113 files; T10 focused 78/78; real local D1 49/49; lint/typecheck/build/30-migration
smoke/local schema/diff PASS — repeated from the clean detached exact-SHA checkout.
No migration; 0023–0030 untouched. Main NOT merged. Production NOT deployed. Remote D1
NOT touched. **T10 COMPLETE — READY FOR INDEPENDENT REVIEW.** T11/T12 NOT STARTED.

## Historical T10 state — initial freeze 6c28858 (superseded by 4c414fa)

Repository `vb-2f/frigo-dev` (repository ID 1364064929; task lineage `vn-2e/frigo-dev`).
Branch `hoplite/himera-6d3eda84-t10-observation-reconciliation`, the platform-verified
successor created from the configured train base after PR #1 merged the frozen T09
branch internally (train merge `668920fa462524e65a79d31a7b0844720baf38e0`; main
`d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa` is untouched and NOT merged).
**T10 application freeze: `6c28858acd0627d2d602998107c2e260c5e4f0d5`** —
`feat(t10): add inventory observation reconciliation authority` — published/fetched
with local == remote == clean-checkout equality. T10 adds the observation/evidence/
reconciliation layer above T09 authority without any second stock writer: additive
`0030` observation/decision persistence (evidence never mutates inventory), a pure
deterministic planner (MATCH / NO_ACTION / STALE / AMBIGUOUS / CONFLICT /
PROPOSE_CORRECTION / PROPOSE_MOVE / PROPOSE_EXPIRY_UPDATE / UNSUPPORTED) with exact
milli quantities, name-matching refusal, contextual-unit refusal and confirmed-expiry
precedence, and a decision authority that composes existing T09 CORRECT/MOVE commands
in one atomic batch with receipt-backed response-loss replay and IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT
on altered semantics. Baseline before edits: 2,926/108 full, 44 real D1, all static
gates PASS. At the freeze: 2,990 full/112 files; T10 focused 1,097/19 files; real
local-D1 49/49; lint/typecheck/build/30-migration smoke/local schema gate (requires
0030)/diff PASS — all repeated from the clean detached exact-remote-SHA checkout with
empty status. No HTTP routes added (T09 precedent; T11 owns UX surfaces).
**T10 COMPLETE — READY FOR INDEPENDENT REVIEW.** T11 and T12 are NOT STARTED.
Exact evidence: `inventory-truth/t10/VERIFICATION.md`, `inventory-truth/t10/TEST_MATRIX.md`.

## Historical T09 state — FEFO v2 backfill compatibility (superseded as current; freeze remains a verified ancestor)

Repository `vn-2e/frigo-dev` (live origin `vb-2f/frigo-dev`, same lineage), branch
`hoplite/himera-6d3eda84`, the platform-verified successor checked out at the exact
previous docs HEAD `8552fe5337245f2ac8349933c02946bf7d9dcc8f` (`hoplite/kydonia-2785bb72` tip unchanged there).
**New final T09 application freeze: `bf391c5fdcdd9e9c2f2257db515815e082cb4381`** — `fix(t09): support backfilled
mappings in fefo authority` — published/fetched with local/remote equality PASS.
The last remaining P1 is fixed: FEFO v2 now serves legitimate adopted/backfilled
synthetic lot mappings. Equal-ID authority was replaced, not bypassed: additive
`0029_inventory_fefo_backfill_compatibility.sql` recreates only the two v2 FEFO
triggers so a lot acts under its legacy projection identity only when LEGACY_BACKFILL
provenance, source identity and the immutable adoption receipt prove the mapping with
a preserved version offset; prestate parity accepts the exact kg/l display aliases;
poststate guards stay strict and native equal-ID lots pass unchanged. P1 reproduced
first (13/13 new tests fail DRIFT_DETECTED on the pre-fix tree, zero mutation).
Fresh PASS: 1,237 focused/15 files (59.52s); 2,926 full/108 (118.20s); 44 real
local-D1; lint/typecheck/build/29-migration smoke/local schema/diff. Clean detached
exact-remote-SHA checkout repeated every gate: 2,926/108 (119.10s), 44 D1, empty
git status. NO GITHUB CI STATUS for the branch. No route invokes v2 FEFO; the adopted
cook path already uses synthetic-compatible v1 commands. Verdict: **READY FOR FINAL
MAIN MERGE REVIEW** (main not merged by this agent). Exact evidence:
`inventory-truth/t09/FINAL_PATCH_VERIFICATION.md`.

## Historical backfill compatibility state — superseded by bf391c5

Repository `vn-2e/frigo-dev`, branch `hoplite/kydonia-2785bb72`.
Final backfill compatibility application freeze: **`df73bc035c2938b6fd082c57f6bca89a82d8e443`**.
The inherited backfilled PATCH P1 is reproduced and fixed without migrations:
synthetic lot IDs are authenticated by the immutable mapping and exact household
adoption witness. Projection CAS, event IDs, replay and composition retain both identities.
Fresh PASS: 619 focused/nine files; 2,910 full/107; 42 isolated real local-D1;
all lint/typecheck/build/migration/local-schema/diff gates. Exact fetched SHA also
passed frozen install, full 2,910/107, all gates and 42 D1 tests in a clean worktree.
**NOT READY FOR MAIN**: the bounded shared-caller check found v2 FEFO still rejects
synthetic mappings in unchanged 0027 SQL. Its fail-closed boundary is preserved;
further compatibility needs separately authorized schema work, not a guard bypass.
Exact evidence and next action: `inventory-truth/t09/FINAL_PATCH_VERIFICATION.md`.

## Historical PATCH parity checkpoint — superseded by df73bc0

Repository `vn-2e/frigo-dev`, branch `hoplite/kydonia-2785bb72`.
New final application freeze: `e796f695bdb4228853992cdedc4e3cecf3437adb` (published/fetched equality).
External final review's storage replay and category parity defects were reproduced
and fixed. Complete normalized request presence/value is retained in native receipts;
CORRECT/MOVE/category commit atomically; historical response replay no longer reads
today's stock. Native commands without PATCH metadata are unchanged.
Fresh gates: 515 focused / six files, 2,865 full / 106 files, 40 isolated local-D1,
lint/typecheck/build/28-migration smoke/local schema/diff PASS.
Recommendation: **NOT READY FOR MAIN**. An inherited P1 remains: PATCH of an
adopted backfilled legacy lot rejects its legitimate distinct mapping with
`500 DRIFT_DETECTED`. No adoption/migration fix was attempted in this narrow task.
Exact clean-source evidence, historical SHAs and next action:
`inventory-truth/t09/FINAL_PATCH_VERIFICATION.md`.

## Historical evidence — all prior freeze/readiness claims below are superseded

## T09 F/G/H complete — 2026-09-11

Independent review follow-up `27427383d61930ea1b67ccbc1d69bb1cc069f931` is published on the same branch. It restores exact adopted PATCH response-loss replay before legacy version preflight, rejects altered key reuse, and retains normal CAS for a distinct key. Fresh full verification: 2,838 tests / 105 files PASS (165.25s), lint/typecheck/build and 28-migration smoke PASS.

T09F = COMPLETE, T09G = COMPLETE, T09H = COMPLETE (freeze + evidence). Application
freeze SHA: `9bf9ac0fe7b5e0d39615f39ae5cc30f84569af2f`, published/fetched on **hoplite/kydonia-2785bb72** with exact
local/remote equality; branch base `hoplite/kos-2a686759` is the platform read-only
configured base at `aa44d2a2f80ea33fd4b328aba906660c0129051e` and refused publication, so the verified successor
continues that exact lineage (same pattern as the prior transfer). A–E unchanged.
Full gates at this checkpoint: **2,837 tests / 105 files PASS** (155s), including the new 19-test adoption suite, 9-test G concurrency matrix and rewritten 14-test writer-fence suite; 38 isolated real local-D1 tests PASS; lint PASS; typecheck PASS; build PASS; 28-migration smoke PASS; local D1 schema gate PASS (0028 required).
Adoption: atomic receipt-backed `executeInventoryAdoption` (migration 0028), empty-household
activation evidence, executor-owned snapshot/authority validation, projection-compatibility
preflight. Every inventory writer now serves adopted households through the lot authority
(manual create/edit/discard, scan confirm, shopping import, cook) and fails closed with
`INVENTORY_AUTHORITY_REQUIRED` when mappings are incomplete; DEC-012 remains SAFE-DEFERRED.
G matrix: USE/USE, USE/DISCARD, USE/CORRECT, DISCARD/DISCARD, MOVE/MOVE, OPEN/OPEN,
FEFO/FEFO, receipt replay, duplicate event identity, household isolation, cross-tenant
identities, adoption races and stale-legacy-post-activation all pass with property sweeps.
Not authorized/started: main merge, deployment, remote D1, PayOS, T10. Independent
review readiness: READY FOR EXTERNAL ASTRA REVIEW (reviewer decides next steps).

## Historical continuation record — 2026-09-11 (superseded)

Latest verified/published application: `aa43e069edbff7843e9eb7532ff386b27be96a17`.
Same task, A–E COMPLETE; F IN_PROGRESS; G/H NOT_STARTED. F now has pure adoption
preparation, in-transaction legacy writer refusal for mapped households, scan/
shopping stock-revision fences, shopping claim/lease/response-loss recovery, and
server-scan confirmation recovery without duplicate manual additions. DEC-012 is
unchanged. No adoption activation or functional mapped-household adapters yet.
Fresh gates: **1,347 focused / 19 files**, **2,808 full / 103 files**, 38 actual
isolated local-D1 tests within those gates, lint/typecheck/27-migration smoke/build
and diff/protected-path checks PASS. Two scoped independent-review P2 findings
were fixed/retested; no remaining P1/P2 in this partial increment. Full F still
requires retained scan-intent validation, atomic adoption and all writer adapters.
Next: additive v3 atomic adoption authority, then functional adapters, G and H.
Detailed evidence/failures: `inventory-truth/t09/VERIFICATION.md`.

Canonical repository: **vn-2d/frigo-dev**. Writable successor:
**hoplite/kos-2a686759**, directly from verified interrupted F
`66858c5296b38715e4bfca77fca5eefe5adadf5a` on read-only prior continuation
`hoplite/orchemenos-e002591e`. Transfer/ancestry PASS; baseline 2,685 tests / 99
files, typecheck/lint/27-migration smoke/build PASS. At takeover: 18 ahead / 0
behind unchanged origin/main. Exact authority/evidence: `inventory-truth/t09/CONTINUATION.md`.
Earlier repository references are historical provenance only.

The following pre-transfer chronology is historical. Continuation was based on frozen T09D remote
811f7e8463303e010199741d66f88ab8a817212d. Successor documentation checkpoint
8bf32ed4e41ed3341215c6376e0c13ef13043616 was published/fetched before E code.
A–E complete; E published as `9bd1e6bc000cd2e94121469babb1a5eb63a5047f`.
Fetch/equality/ancestry PASS. F is in progress; G–H pending.
E adds deterministic 1–32-effect atomic FEFO, version-2 receipts/events and additive
0027; v1 authority and migrations 0023–0026 remain intact. No adoption, live writer,
HTTP or UI cutover. Latest post-fence gates: 1,172 focused / 11 files (35 actual
local D1 tests), 2,659 full / 98 files, lint/typecheck/build and migration smoke
PASS. Scoped independent E review has no remaining P1/P2 findings. Earlier
1,170 focused / 2,657 full results predate the ordered-receipt fence.
F first safety change implemented: DEC-012 guest transfers explicitly reject
before OTP/account/session or data mutation. Guest/auth/outbox focused 143 PASS;
full 2,685 / 99 files and lint/typecheck/build/27-migration smoke PASS. General
adoption and manual/scan/shopping/cook adapters remain next per
`inventory-truth/t09/F_ADOPTION_PLAN.md`. Full F completion is not claimed.
Exact chronology, limits and corrected failures: `inventory-truth/t09/VERIFICATION.md`.
See `inventory-truth/t09/CONTINUATION.md` for exact branch authority, checks,
publication restriction and preserved pre-existing settings overlay. All protected
surfaces untouched; no application freeze or independent-review readiness.

## Historical T09D checkpoint — 2026-09-10

Program: Inventory Truth Layer. Canonical repository: vn-2b/frigo-dev (user
confirmed). Branch: hoplite/euhesperides-d77023a5. Exact T08 base:
8f8788c1a0c9e486657751ef3875a5baa5334dec. Main anchor: d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa.
Publication-first and A/B checkpoints published/fetched. T09C now implements
internal native command persistence with membership, CAS/revision fence, immutable
receipt/event and exact legacy projection; additive 0024 and actual local D1
rollback/executor tests. No HTTP exposure, historical adoption or old writer cutover.
Mixed legacy households fail closed with ADOPTION_REQUIRED. Full/native gates and
corrected findings are recorded in inventory-truth/t09/VERIFICATION.md.
Published C checkpoint 13133b3: 507 focused, 1,994 full / 93 files PASS;
lint/typecheck/build, 24-migration/local schema PASS; remote-source worktree 507 PASS.
T09D now validates retained receipt/event evidence, binds new events to declared
effects and actual written stock (additive 0025/0026), and rejects paired evidence
corruption. Final D gates: 1,031 focused / 2,518 full tests (95 files), lint,
typecheck, build, 26-migration replay/local schema PASS. D code checkpoint
b036b257a8ad775dd6f1a445dcfdcce38a6babf1 published/fetched with exact equality;
separate fetched-source worktree: 1,031 tests and typecheck PASS, clean tree.
Next: E FEFO and F legacy adoption/writer integration.
T09 remains IN_PROGRESS; no application freeze or independent-review readiness.
No main, legacy Frigo, production/staging, remote D1 or PayOS changes; no T10.
The release/T08 sections below are historical evidence, not current work authority.

## T08 COMPLETE — authorized publication (2026-09-10)

Repository `vn-2c/Frigo`. The user explicitly approved publication on
`hoplite/xanthos-7d942897` instead of the blocked original feature name (DEC-006).
That branch is now the canonical cross-account handoff; publish and fetch confirmed
`fb00f46d4633c9659e812be9f86119533973a8bd`, followed by this docs-only completion
receipt. Last code: `dd2ecc6f7066250dfdc5214a3d6c356e1479b61e`.
Base/final fetched main: `d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa`, unchanged.

Implemented additive 0023 storage/lot schema, strict quantity/money/expiry/source
contracts, guarded insert-only legacy backfill, compatibility projection/parity.
No legacy API/read/write path cutover. Fresh final-session **130 focused tests**,
**1,617 full tests / 89 files**, lint/typecheck/build, 23-migration replay/local
schema and diff checks PASS. Prior sandbox-local D1 apply passed 23/23. Early
failures and publication denial are resolved and preserved in the evidence log.
No source/test/schema change since dd2ecc6; later commits are documentation-only.

Next action: next account checks out `origin/hoplite/xanthos-7d942897`, reads the
handoff and final report, and waits for a separately authorized T09 task. No T09
implementation, main integration or deployment is implied by T08 completion.

Read `inventory-truth/MASTER_CONTEXT.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `TASK_BOARD.md`,
`DECISIONS.md`, `VERIFICATION.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md` and
`inventory-truth/T08_VERIFICATION.md` and `tasks/T08-inventory-truth-foundation.md`
for exact evidence, final Git anchors, limitations and T09 prerequisites.
Main, production/staging, remote D1, PayOS and release operations untouched.

## Authoritative source

- GitHub source of truth: main.
- Deployed application SHA: `bdb0dda0b1123c4fd940058091e3cb285d5e8eb8`.
- Commits after the deployed application are documentation-only receipt merges;
  verify the current `main` head from GitHub when preparing a later release.
- Current `github-frigo/main` observed 2026-09-12: `db2377fd9f63d1be38ce3882c6d8173e0bf9e497`.
- GitHub API redirects `vn-2c/Frigo` to canonical public repository
  `Tungjpstore/Frigo`; the configured `github-frigo` remote remains the alias.
- OCR recovery branch: `codex/ocr-production-recovery`, based at `d8ca112a5ac5eb215f36a3f89b4218e2fc691371`;
  candidate implementation is committed at `ec87aec` and deployed through
  merge commit `bdb0dda0b1123c4fd940058091e3cb285d5e8eb8`.
- The 2026-09-13 PR #17 merge added the OCR recovery implementation to `main`;
  production now reports the merge SHA and Worker version recorded below.
- PRODUCTION_APPLICATION_BASE_SHA:
  `23ef51d6ec12a5a3e319a2d941dca39d2775cb9d`.
- PRE_CLEANUP_MAIN_HEAD: `41d2de6bc76331322cc63e8038432b0b02f60da1`.
- APPLICATION INTEGRATION: complete in main at `23ef51d6ec12a5a3e319a2d941dca39d2775cb9d`.
- Verified application SHA: `0b20061e7dc7405df68b18a18da4166e09494ecd`.
- Verified release head: `0420807968538f61b669569d064c404f67032174`.
- Main head before this correction: `41d2de6bc76331322cc63e8038432b0b02f60da1`.
- The main merge tree is source-equivalent to the verified release head.
- Changes after the historical application base now include the merged OCR
  recovery implementation and its additive migration; the production receipt
  is anchored to `bdb0dda0…`.

## Verification snapshot

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Full suite | 1,487 tests / 87 files PASS |
| Focused T02-T07 | 819 tests / 40 files PASS |
| Clean D1 | 22 / 22 migrations PASS |
| Upgrade sanity | 0020 -> 0022 PASS |
| Existing data | 776 rows / 58 tables preserved |
| Browser | 264 assertions / 36 phases PASS |
| Payment-adjacent | 82 tests / 7 files PASS |
| Main CI | 34396319671 SUCCESS |
| Previous final-head CI | 34405307196 SUCCESS |

These are the preserved release gates; the post-cutover local gates and remote
schema/Week checks are recorded in the receipt below.

## Deployment and production boundary

- Previous release deploy workflow `34396457582`: **SUCCESS**.
- Previous docs-cleanup deploy workflow `34405457796`: **SUCCESS**.
- Release packaging completed.
- Staging was not provisioned; no staging deployment occurred.
- Production DB migration: **COMPLETE** - D1 `frigo-db` ledger contains exactly `0001` through `0023`; `0023` was applied additively on 2026-09-13 after the retained backup.
- Production deployment: **COMPLETE** - Worker deployed with Wrangler OAuth from candidate SHA `bdb0dda0b1123c4fd940058091e3cb285d5e8eb8`.
- Production reconciliation: **COMPLETE** - post-cutover source, schema, health and traffic checks passed.
- Active deployment: Cloudflare version `df7225c9-6f20-4206-9f16-573de6a69c43`, 100% traffic, deployed 2026-09-13T01:01:24Z.
- OCR recovery: **DEPLOYED AND VERIFIED**. Remote D1 `0023` is applied and gated;
  Qwen secret and non-PII smoke passed; readiness reports commit `bdb0dda0…`.
- Planner rollout: NOT STARTED.
- Production secret `QWEN_API_KEY` was added from the operator clipboard; its
  value is never stored in the repository or logs. Existing secret names include
  `JWT_SECRET`,
  `OTP_HASH_SECRET`, `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`, `QWEN_API_KEY` and optional
  `GROQ_API_KEY`. The Qwen key value is not written to the repository or logs.

## Production cutover receipt (2026-09-10)

Verified against `https://frigo.tungjpstore.net` after the cutover:

- Worker readiness: HTTP 200, `status=degraded`, `environment=production`, and
  full `commit=d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa`; database/queue/AI/email
  are `ok`/`configured`, rate limiting is `kv-best-effort`, and the only issue is
  the non-blocking warning `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING`.
- Liveness and landing smoke: `GET /` and `GET /api/v1/health` returned HTTP 200;
  readiness smoke passed with database `ok` and no fatal configuration issue.
- Exact remote schema gate: PASS; migration ledger is exactly 22 entries
  (`0001`-`0022`), foreign-key violations are `0`, and the Week strict
  reconciliation is 2/2 plans with 0 orphan rows and 0 mismatches.
- Key preserved row counts: users 28, households 28, inventory items 13,
  recipes 59, meal plans 2, scan queue jobs 15, sessions 2, auth OTPs 0.
- CORS verification: the exact trusted origin receives its own ACAO header;
  path-bearing, localhost and arbitrary origins receive no ACAO header.
- Backup retained at `.artifacts/frigo-db-pre-main-d1b0673-20260910T205627Z.sql`,
  mode 600, 521095 bytes, SHA-256
  `000c9cb88d6045afb19cca6ce3e1caa308b20ffa214dbb2cddfca0cb78d722eb`.
- Deployment used a clean detached checkout at the approved main SHA and
  `GIT_COMMIT` injection only; no planner flag, PayOS/payment path or secret
  value was changed.

## OCR production-recovery candidate (2026-09-12)

The candidate addresses provider/model recovery and scan failure handling without
changing the production receipt above:

- Candidate schema now includes additive migration `0023_scan_request_fingerprint.sql`;
  local replay and schema checks cover `0001`-`0023`. Production D1 migration
  `0023` was applied after backup `.artifacts/frigo-db-pre-ocr-20260913T005253Z.sql`
  (SHA-256 `bc62e5844c6a838a3b1b98d29dffa39c9d6cf6e1d570617e843c9e3e820bb088`).

- Qwen `qwen3.7-flash` is the primary provider for vision, receipt OCR, chat and
  recipe ranking through the DashScope international OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  (`QWEN_BASE_URL`, `QWEN_MODEL`); structured requests disable thinking. Groq is
  retained only as an explicit legacy fallback (`GROQ_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true`),
  and is disabled in the candidate vars.
- Native Cloudflare vision remains opt-in through
  `CLOUDFLARE_VISION_FALLBACK=false`. DeepSeek remains the optional text/ranking
  fallback when `DEEPSEEK_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true`, and Z.ai/GLM the optional
  vision/text extension path when `GLM_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true`; a GLM-5.3 Flash
  upgrade is future work and is not claimed as active.
- Vision and receipt responses pass Zod validation plus a deterministic quality
  gate: generic/placeholder labels and confidence below `0.6` are removed;
  no usable rows return `AI_SCAN_NO_USABLE_ITEMS` instead of a fabricated draft.
- Typed provider errors classify permanent `MODEL_NOT_FOUND`, auth/permission,
  license, schema/invalid-response and quality failures separately from retryable
  `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`, `NETWORK_ERROR`, `RATE_LIMITED` and `UPSTREAM_ERROR` errors;
  queue retries remain bounded by the existing attempt/DLQ contract.
- Scan status responses expose bounded error codes and retry metadata; OCR output
  remains untrusted draft data requiring review and confirmation.
- Focused local checks on 2026-09-13: Qwen provider ESLint PASS;
  provider/recovery, queue, quota, scan-route and UI tests PASS. The complete
  candidate `pnpm check` gate is green: 1,579 tests / 93 files PASS, lint,
  typecheck, migration replay through `0023` and production build all PASS.
- Live provider access is **VERIFIED**: non-PII chat smoke returned HTTP 200 from
  DashScope with model `qwen3.7-flash` and response `OK`. Production readiness
  returned HTTP 200 with `ai=configured`, database/queue `ok`, and only the
  existing non-blocking `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING` warning.

## Verification commands

- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm typecheck`: PASS.
- `pnpm check:migrations`: PASS (`migration-smoke=ok`).
- `pnpm build`: PASS.
- `pnpm test`: 1,427/1,487 passed; 60 failures are confined to the two known
  shell/jsdom UI suites (`localStorage`/`container` unavailable). Hosted exact-SHA
  CI run `34413458369` remains the authoritative 1,487/87 PASS gate.
- `pnpm schema:check:remote`: PASS; `pnpm week:reconcile:remote -- --strict --json`: PASS.
- `pnpm audit --prod`: 2 moderate `react-router` advisories via
  `react-router-dom` (patched upstream at 7.18.0; major upgrade not included in
  this cutover). Full dependency audit reports 21 findings, with the remainder
  confined to development/tooling paths (`wrangler`/`miniflare`/`jsdom`).
- Read-only lineage checks: `git ls-remote --heads github-frigo main` returned
  `db2377fd9f63d1be38ce3882c6d8173e0bf9e497`; `git rev-list --left-right --count
  HEAD...github-frigo/main` returned `0 2`; no remote fetch or mutation was run.
- `git diff --check`: PASS for this documentation checkpoint.
- OCR candidate local lint/typecheck/test/build/migration checks: **PASS** on
  2026-09-13. Hosted PR #17 CI run `34728606704` also passed (1,579 tests / 93
  files). Live non-PII Qwen smoke, migration `0023`, deployment and readiness
  evidence are verified; only the non-blocking Plus Grant warning remains.
- Wrangler OAuth is authenticated as `tungbipdz@gmail.com` (account
  `ef250a88911fd24073cb73d1c07e0218`).

## PR #8 metadata

PR #8 METADATA:

Authoritative GitHub state: `MERGED`, `isDraft=false`,
`mergedAt=2026-09-09T19:38:59Z`, `closedAt=2026-09-09T19:38:59Z`,
`mergeCommit=23ef51d6ec12a5a3e319a2d941dca39d2775cb9d`, base `main`, head
`hoplite/kirrha-5f4057f0` at `0420807968538f61b669569d064c404f67032174`.

Application integration and PR metadata are separate facts: application
integration is complete in main at `23ef51d`; PR #8 was already merged and was
not reopened, re-merged or modified.

## Kirrha archival state

Kirrha is two commits ahead of current main and differs in four `docs/ai/` files
only. There are no application differences on that historical branch that are
absent from main. Do not merge or revert kirrha.

## Protected areas

PayOS/payment code untouched.

No real payment performed.

## Next task

Next task: MONITOR OCR QUALITY/LATENCY AND SCHEDULE REACT ROUTER UPGRADE

Keep the deployed Worker and planner flags at their safe defaults while the OCR
candidate is validated. Run the focused provider/queue/UI tests, all required
local gates and an authorized live-provider smoke against the exact candidate SHA;
then obtain hosted CI, readiness and canary evidence before any production deploy.
No remote migration or production secret change has been performed for this
candidate. Migration `0023_scan_request_fingerprint.sql` is required before a
guarded deploy; do not touch PayOS/payment or use a down-migration. Until a new
readiness receipt exists, the production receipt remains the direct Wrangler
deployment above; rollback is code-only to a schema-compatible SHA.

The deployed receipt is anchored to main SHA
`d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa`; the pre-cleanup main head is
`41d2de6bc76331322cc63e8038432b0b02f60da1`.

## OCR image payload optimization (2026-09-13)

- Local candidate `src/web/lib/private-image.ts` now decodes gallery images in
  memory, caps the longest side at 2,000 px, and emits JPEG quality `0.82` only
  when the derivative is smaller; small images are never upscaled.
- The original `File` is not modified or persisted. Private-session fencing and
  cancellation cover the async bitmap/canvas path; unsupported browsers fall
  back to the existing `FileReader` data URL flow.
- The attached 1,086x1,448 receipt measured 2,116,353 bytes as PNG. A local
  JPEG quality-0.82 conversion measured 382,334 bytes (81.9% reduction) without
  changing pixel dimensions. Provider OCR recall has not yet been re-run on the
  browser-generated derivative.
- Regression coverage: `tests/unit/scan-privacy.test.tsx` now has 11 passing
  tests, including resize, no-upscale and cancellation cases.
- Status: **COMMITTED LOCALLY / NOT DEPLOYED** at `ba3d872eea2d677e38f94adb8355f493c4c45852`.
  Next action is device/browser OCR smoke with the attached receipt, then open
  the release review for promotion.

## Qwen runtime governance candidate (2026-09-13)

- Working branch: `feat/qwen-ai-runtime-cost-router`.
- Base SHA: `05423f2ad675006a4c7913e696f1979b3fcaae59` (`github-frigo/main`).
  Canonical `main` is unchanged; no production deployment is authorized.
- Application checkpoint: `21c442d` (`feat(ai): add governed qwen task runtime`).
  Documentation remains a separate local checkpoint after this implementation.
- Added `QwenTaskRuntime`, model-role governance, versioned prompt registry,
  centralized pricing, bounded budgets/escalation, structured validation and
  isolate-safe usage telemetry. Production Worker composition now explicitly
  builds this path with `AI_QWEN_ONLY=true` and the role aliases in
  `wrangler.jsonc`.
- Scan HTTP, scan queue and meal explanation constructors share the same
  server-side AI config helper. Legacy non-Qwen adapters remain only for
  compatibility when Qwen-only mode is not selected; they are not constructed
  by the production path.
- Inventory boundary is intentionally limited to this repository: the final
  T08-T12 Inventory Truth AI-to-observation-to-reconciliation certification is
  pending later unification with `frigo-dev`; no code or migrations were
  imported from that lineage.
- Offline golden fixtures and `pnpm ai:eval -- --dry-run` were added. No live
  Alibaba request is made by tests or CI. Optional shadow traffic is disabled
  by default and now reserves its call/token budget before launching.
- Final local verification: `pnpm check` PASS with 1,606 tests / 95 files,
  lint, typecheck, migration replay and production build all PASS. The check
  intentionally skipped remote D1 schema and Week parity because no release
  flag was supplied. `pnpm ai:eval -- --dry-run` and `git diff --check` PASS.
- Focused recertification command covered Qwen runtime/provider, router,
  configuration, explanation, image privacy and scan queue paths: **119 tests /
  8 files PASS**. No concrete runtime defect was found during the final review;
  readiness already probes the additive scan columns from migration `0023`.
- `pnpm audit --prod` remains a known non-blocking follow-up: two moderate
  `react-router` advisories are fixed upstream at `>=7.18.0`; this task did not
  change dependencies.
- Candidate publication is complete: `feat/qwen-ai-runtime-cost-router` was
  pushed normally to `github-frigo`, and `git ls-remote` verified the remote
  SHA against the local candidate. Canonical `main` remains unchanged at
  `05423f2`; no merge, remote migration or deployment occurred. Next action is
  code review or a separately authorized Qwen benchmark.

## Qwen pre-unification hardening (2026-09-13)

- Application implementation/publication SHA: `f8468eaa7d7fed3cbcf5ac7e780eca07ad3d71e4`.
- Final pre-documentation branch head (including the scheduler-failure
  regression test) is `a145ef5`; the docs checkpoint is a subsequent commit.
- The normal push was verified against `github-frigo/feat/qwen-ai-runtime-cost-router`
  at that SHA; this documentation checkpoint is a subsequent local commit.
- OCR capability metadata is centralized in `packages/ai/src/model-governance.ts`.
  `qwen-vl-ocr` is treated as a rolling alias (`pinned=false`), omits both
  provider `response_format` and `enable_thinking`, and continues application
  JSON parsing, normalization, Zod validation and quality gates. Supported
  Qwen multimodal models retain provider JSON mode.
- Singapore low-context estimates are now versioned as
  `estimate-2026-09-sg-low-context` for the fast/multimodal/OCR/reasoning tiers;
  judge remains an explicitly documented planning estimate. Cost telemetry is
  still estimated and reconstructable from model, token counts, cache counts and
  pricing version.
- Vision payloads are rejected before provider inference using decoded base64/data
  URL byte estimates. Defaults are 5 MiB for `AI_MAX_IMAGE_BYTES` and
  `AI_MAX_OCR_IMAGE_BYTES`, bounded to 64 KiB-20 MiB; remote URLs remain unknown
  at this layer and rely on upstream storage/upload limits.
- Shadow canary remains `AI_SHADOW_CANARY_PERCENT=0` by default. When enabled,
  it reserves call/token budget and is scheduled only through the optional
  `backgroundExecutor` (`ExecutionContext.waitUntil` in HTTP routes); queue and
  other hosts without an executor skip shadow safely. Scheduler invocation
  failures are isolated so the primary response remains successful.
- Focused regression command: **134 tests / 8 files PASS**. Full `pnpm check`:
  **1,623 tests / 95 files PASS**, lint/typecheck/migration replay/build PASS.
  `pnpm ai:eval -- --dry-run` and `git diff --check` PASS. `pnpm audit --prod`
  remains FAIL with the two pre-existing moderate React Router advisories
  (patched upstream at `>=7.18.0`); no dependency upgrade was made.
- No live Qwen benchmark, production deploy, remote migration, secret change,
  merge, or PayOS/payment change was performed. T08-T12 Inventory Truth work
  remains pending U01/U02 and is not imported here.
- Branch publication target remains `feat/qwen-ai-runtime-cost-router`; verify
  the final commit SHA with `git ls-remote` after the normal push. Next action:
  code review, then a separately authorized benchmark/release decision.
Record the new post-merge main SHA in the final operator receipt; the
pre-cleanup main head is `41d2de6bc76331322cc63e8038432b0b02f60da1`.

## SAFE STOP — T13R-B — 2026-09-13T21:35Z

Branch `hoplite/medma-164548ce`, WIP `7e68e3b` (P2-1 `4d587eb` below it).
T13R-B truthful presentation + conflict remediation code/tests complete and
green on executed checks (typecheck, t13r-b-presentation 12/12, full
Playwright 51 passed); certification and freeze not started. Details:
`docs/ai/inventory-truth/t13/T13R_B_REMEDIATION.md`.
## Canonical promotion CLI checkpoint (2026-09-15)

- GitHub CLI identity: `Tungjpstore`; target `vn-dlo/Frigo-dev` (repository ID
  `1368281478`) is reachable with push access, but the account has no admin or
  maintain permission.
- PR #1 remains open from `canonical/5f6853d-promotion`. The promotion head was
  advanced by one empty commit, `ae1689c1f5525262da3478137b402692e4e4ed45`,
  solely to retrigger pull-request validation; its tree is unchanged.
- Exact hosted CI is still absent: no workflow run, check run, or status exists
  for the promotion head. Manual dispatch was rejected by GitHub with HTTP 422:
  `Actions has been disabled for this user`.
- No merge, deployment, remote migration, production KV/R2/D1 mutation, or
  payment/PayOS change was performed. Promotion remains blocked pending hosted
  CI and maintainer/admin authorization.
- Repository-owner authentication is now active in `gh` as `vn-dlo`, with
  admin/maintain access. `main` protection was enabled: PR required, one
  approving review, `validate` status required, force-push and deletion blocked.
- Promotion head is now `6ec7ff08ef258ef2ca95fb5d24b581b939ef1c92` after a
  second empty, tree-neutral CI trigger commit. Hosted CI still has no run.
- A clean owner-visible PR #2 is now at
  `8eb6d2b8d54e5e2fd08c0a11acd9f57a1e068b24`; exact hosted CI run
  `34968012294` passed validate, lint, typecheck, Vitest, migration smoke, and
  build. The PR remains blocked only by the required independent approval.

## Google GIS popup blank-page fix (2026-09-16)

- Root cause isolated from the production `/auth` response and Safari symptom:
  Hono `secureHeaders` was emitting `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`,
  which breaks the opener relationship Google Identity Services needs for its
  popup credential handshake.
- The Worker now disables Hono's fixed COOP value and applies a path-aware
  policy after routing: SPA documents use `same-origin-allow-popups`, while
  `/api/*` responses retain `same-origin` isolation. `public/_headers` matches
  the SPA policy for static hosting.
- Regression coverage in `tests/integration/worker-cors.test.mjs` proves both
  headers and prevents weakening API isolation. Focused auth/COOP tests pass
  (`17/17`); lint, typecheck and `git diff --check` also pass.
- Published through PR #9 after exact-head hosted CI passed. Worker version
  `20bc1f35-6ffe-4085-ba79-d54a0b53da71` now serves 100% of the custom domain.
  Post-deploy smoke passed; `/auth` returns `same-origin-allow-popups`, API
  responses retain `same-origin`, and readiness reports database/queue/AI/email
  healthy with only the pre-existing `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING`
  warning. No migration, secret, PayOS, DNS, KV, R2 or queue mutation occurred.
## T18C continuation — approved source recovered (2026-09-21)

Resumed `2e770f8e93bdda63dc3534093dc313d99fab229d` on the existing
`feat/t18c-final-redesign-certification` branch. Repository ID `1368281478`
now resolves to owner-authorized `vn-tako/Frigo-dev`; main remains `b8447e85`.
Upstream corrected to the matching origin branch. Pre-existing
`.hoplite/settings.json` is preserved and excluded from task commits.

`PORT=5173 pnpm exec playwright test -c playwright.t18c.config.ts
tests/e2e/t17-ui/t18c-matrix.e2e.ts`: **6 passed**, 162 screenshots,
162 strict axe audits with **zero violations**, zero overflow. This fresh
pause-tree result does not yet certify the upcoming source-led fixes.
The original ZIP is now available; see `T18C_SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md`.
Direct comparison is underway; desktop composition/breakpoint and keyboard
findings are being classified. Status: **T18C_PARTIAL**. Full T17 regression
and final gates remain pending. VoiceOver/NVDA NOT PERFORMED. No merge,
deployment, remote migration, or T18D work.
